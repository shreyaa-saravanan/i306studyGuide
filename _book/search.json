    "text": "Preface\nThis is the study guide for a University of Texas at Austin, School of Information course in the undergraduate Informatics major: I306 Statistics for Informatics. It was developed during the Spring 2023 semester, so some of the material is already dated and the instructor will point out that material during class sessions.\nThis study guide supplements our main textbook, Diez, Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Barr (2019) and our secondary textbook, Wickham, Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Grolemund (2023). We will go over the study guide in class instead of slideshows, which will only be used on the first and last day of class.\nThis book was created using the Quarto document publishing system, which is the same system you will use to complete all homework and the take-home final exam in this course. Consequently, the guide describes many details of Quarto, some of which you will need to complete homework and some of which are optional. Quarto is an example of tools for reproducible research and literate programming, two important concepts in science that will be discussed in class sessions. Quarto can be used to produce books, websites, presentations, documents, and more. This is a Quarto book. To learn more about Quarto books visit https://quarto.org/docs/books.\nNote that the display of a Quarto book has three parts: (1) a left sidebar, containing a list of book chapters and a search box that can return results from any chapter, (2) the body, containing the text of the current chapter, and (3) a right sidebar, containing the table of contents for just the current chapter."

    "text": "Why Quarto?\nQuarto is free and is being actively developed by Posit, the same company developing RStudio. It provides us with an audit trail of our work, and a platform that allows you to think aloud in a sense, adding code and thoughts and pictures to a document that slowly takes shape as you explore data. You gradually sharpen your ideas and the document along with them and, when you are finished, the document contains all the code, thoughts, pictures, equations, and whatever else you wish to share with your audience."

    "text": "Why R and RStudio?\nR is free and is the leading platform for statisticians in the world today. It is both a language and software that implements that language and is where most statisticians implement their ideas in code. Other statistics platforms such as SPSS are more consumer oriented and don’t receive the amount of debugging and new features that R offers.\nRStudio is free (for our use, there is also a paid version that allows you to collaborate, kind of like Google docs but for data analysis). It is the most prominent IDE for the use of R. It is also an IDE for Python, by the way, although we won’t use Python in this course. It is produced, and the paid version is marketed, by Posit, a company based in Austin that employs as its chief scientist, Hadley Wickham, the leading developer of R software in the world today."

    "text": "1.1 Introducing R and RStudio\nFirst we introduce R and RStudio and, finally, Quarto. First, either use the RStudio server at https://rstudio.ischool.utexas.edu or install R and RStudio, in that order. Some people have trouble installing, especially Windows or Mac. Some Mac users were opening the .dmg file for RStudio as a readonly volume, then open the app on that volume. Instead, you have to drag the RStudio icon to the Applications folder and open it from there. The telltale sign of this problem is that you can’t save any files. Windows users have a different problem. Some Windows users try to install RStudio and R on OneDrive. RStudio won’t run from OneDrive and some Windows users can’t tell the difference between installing on a local hard drive and installing in the cloud on OneDrive."

    "text": "1.2 Console\nThe first thing we can try after installing is to use the console. By default, that is in the lower left of the RStudio window (you can move everything around, though) and it has a command prompt that looks like &gt;. There enter the following function to verify that you can download R packages, which are collections of functions.\n\nlibrary(MASS)\n\nIf this works, you won’t get any output from the library() function but the command prompt will reappear. That function loads the package from the library into our environment so we can use it in the current session. If you screw around with RStudio and particularly if you follow a lot of hints on Stack Overflow, you may end up with several libraries of packages, all out of sync with each other. If you have trouble loading packages from the library, you may want to call the following function to see how many libraries are on your computer and where they are.\n\n.libPaths()\n\n[1] \"/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.3-x86_64/Resources/library\"\n\n\nThis function returns a list of folders containing libraries, one library per folder. You can then use the terminal or a file explorer outside of R to delete some duplicate packages. The important library for this class is /opt/R/4.3.1/lib/R/library. Only I can install packages there. If you need a package that is not installed, it is best to ask me to install it there. You also probably have a personal library where you can install packages, but on this machine, it is better not to do so.\nAfter loading the relative small package known as MASS, go on to install a package that is actually a large set of packages, collectively known as the Tidyverse. This is a set of packages we will use in our homework.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.2     ✔ readr     2.1.4\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.0\n✔ ggplot2   3.4.2     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.2     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\n✖ dplyr::select() masks MASS::select()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nThis takes a while because there are so many packages involved."

    "section": "1.4 Textbook data sets",
    "text": "1.4 Textbook data sets\nOur textbook, Openintro Stats, contains references to a lot of data sets, many of which I’ve downloaded and put into the folder /home/mm223266/data/. You can just use them from this location or go to the URL https://openintro.org/data, but if you can’t remember that, you can just google openintro stats and navigate to the data sets. Look at the metadata for the loan50 data set, which is used in Chapter 1 of the textbook. You can download it in four different formats, the best of which is the .rda file or R Data file. It’s the best because it preserves the data types, in this case dbl, int, and fctr. If we instead import the .csv file, we have to then specify the data types in R, which is an extra step we’d like to avoid when possible.\nWhen we download a file, R doesn’t know where it is automatically. We do one of three things.\n\nChange R to address the folder where we downloaded it\nMove it to the folder R is currently addressing\nKeep R addressing your homework folder, but reach out for the data sets where I’ve downloaded them (only works if you’re using the RStudio Server).\n\nHow you do this depends on the operating system but, in any operating system we use the following three functions.\n\ngetwd()\n\n[1] \"/Users/mcq/courses/stats/book\"\n\n# setwd(\"/home/mm223266/i306/\")\nload(paste0(Sys.getenv(\"STATS_DATA_DIR\"),\"/loan50.rda\"))\n\nThe first function tells us which folder (or directory if you prefer) R is addressing. The second one changes to the folder / directory we would like to use. (I’ve commented it out for this study guide.) The third one addresses the data where I’ve put it but leaves your working directory where it is. This is very convenient because it means that (1) you don’t have to download data sets, and (2) I don’t have to modify your homework file in order to check it.\nMy suggestion is that you create a folder for this class and use the third option. You can make your folder your default in RStudio, using Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; General &gt; Default working directory. Important note To successfully render this document, you must change the second function above to refer to a folder for which you have write permission.\nOnce we load loan50.rda, look at it and try to predict total_credit_limit using annual_income. Keep in mind that, if the file is in the current working directory / folder, R will autocomplete its name when you say load(lo and then press the tab key (assuming there are no other files starting with the letters lo in the same folder). You just have to enter enough letters to make the name unique before you press the tab key. If nothing happens when you press the tab key, you are either in the wrong folder or you have other files starting with the same letters.\n\nhead(loan50)\n\n  state emp_length term homeownership annual_income verified_income\n1    NJ          3   60          rent         59000    Not Verified\n2    CA         10   36          rent         60000    Not Verified\n3    SC         NA   36      mortgage         75000        Verified\n4    CA          0   36          rent         75000    Not Verified\n5    OH          4   60      mortgage        254000    Not Verified\n6    IN          6   36      mortgage         67000 Source Verified\n  debt_to_income total_credit_limit total_credit_utilized\n1      0.5575254              95131                 32894\n2      1.3056833              51929                 78341\n3      1.0562800             301373                 79221\n4      0.5743467              59890                 43076\n5      0.2381496             422619                 60490\n6      1.0770448             349825                 72162\n  num_cc_carrying_balance       loan_purpose loan_amount grade interest_rate\n1                       8 debt_consolidation       22000     B         10.90\n2                       2        credit_card        6000     B          9.92\n3                      14 debt_consolidation       25000     E         26.30\n4                      10        credit_card        6000     B          9.92\n5                       2   home_improvement       25000     B          9.43\n6                       4   home_improvement        6400     B          9.92\n  public_record_bankrupt loan_status has_second_income total_income\n1                      0     Current             FALSE        59000\n2                      1     Current             FALSE        60000\n3                      0     Current             FALSE        75000\n4                      0     Current             FALSE        75000\n5                      0     Current             FALSE       254000\n6                      0     Current             FALSE        67000\n\nsummary(lm(total_credit_limit~annual_income,data=loan50))\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = total_credit_limit ~ annual_income, data = loan50)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-303384  -91959  -38226   89869  239503 \n\nCoefficients:\n               Estimate Std.

However, this is not the only possible conclusion that can be drawn based on your findings so far. What is one other possible explanation for the observed difference between the percentages of patients that are pain free 24 hours after receiving acupuncture in the two groups?\n\nWe can use the tbl object we created to answer these questions.\n\nThe percentage of patients in the treatment group who were pain free was 23.3%.\nThe percentage of patients in the control group who were pain free was 4.3%.\nA higher percent of the treatment group became pain free.\nNot all migraine headaches are alike. It is possible that, due to chance, the patients in the treatment group had less severe migraine headaches that were easier to cure.\n\nExamine the .qmd file that renders into this .html file. You’ll see that, rather than specify the numbers in the answers above, we actually did the calculations inline. What is good about doing this? (Hint: what happens if you add patients to the data set and rerender the document?) What is bad about doing this? (Hint: it looks clumsy and we could just as easily run the calculations in an r chunk, assign the results to object, and name the objects inline.)\nAnother issue is the code for part c. I only accounted for the case where the treatment group has the greater percent. It would be much better to add an else clause to account for the possibility that the answer should be control and an else to account for the two to be equal. The best way to do that is to create a non-echoing chunk and use the results inline. For example, the following chunk only appears in the .qmd file, not the .html file, but its results can be used inline.\nNow we can say that the treatment group had the higher percentage. Only one problem remains and it is a software engineering problem. We haven’t tested the above code on a case where the control group or neither group had the higher percentages.

On the right is how the OpenIntro Stats textbook refers to data types. When you display a tibble (a tibble is a data frame with some extra information) using R, each variable column will be headed with dbl, int, fctr, or ord to indicate the four kinds of numbers. If a variable is not interpreted as a number, R will display chr as an abbreviation of character.\n\n2.3.1 Textbook Exercise 1.7\nWhat were the explanatory and response variables in the migraine study? The group was explanatory and pain_free was the response variable.\n\n\n2.3.2 Textbook Exercise 1.12\nThis is a hard question in two parts.\n\nList the variables used in creating this visualization.\nIndicate whether each variable in the study is numerical or categorical. If numerical, identify as contin- uous or discrete. If categorical, indicate if the variable is ordinal.\n\nThere is actually an r package underlying this question. If you visit https://github.com/dgrtwo/unvotes you will see the data represented as a tibble. If you recall, during week one we said that a tibble is a data frame that behaves well. Among its features is a list of the data types, so you can answer parts a and b by looking at a tibble of the data, where you’ll see that\n\nyear is stored as dbl although it is really discrete and could be stored as int\ncountry is stored as chr which means characters although it is really a nominal factor\npercent_yes is stored as a dbl which is appropriate\nissue is stored as chr although it is really a nominal factor\n\nLater we’ll learn how to produce a visualization like this, although you are welcome to try based on the code at the unvotes website mentioned above. If you want the actual code itself, you can slightly modify the code at https://rpubs.com/minebocek/unvotes to include Mexico."

The sample consists of 600 such patients.\nIs the study generalizable? Can we establish cause and effect? The patients are probably not randomly sampled, so we need to know more to say whether they represent all asthma patients 18–69 who rely on medication. For example, they could all be from a high-pollution city. We would need to know that. The cause and effect determination is easier. An experiment can determine cause and effect, while an observational study only determines association."

Next, randomly assign half the subjects from each age group to exercise twice a week, and instruct the rest not to exercise. Conduct a mental health exam at the beginning and at the end of the study, and compare the results.\n\nWhat type of study is this?\nWhat are the treatment and control groups in this study?\nDoes this study make use of blocking? If so, what is the blocking variable?\nDoes this study make use of blinding?\nComment on whether or not the results of the study can be used to establish a causal relationship between exercise and mental health, and indicate whether or not the conclusions can be generalized to the population at large.\nSuppose you are given the task of determining if this proposed study should get funding. Would you have any reservations about the study proposal?\n\n\n\n2.5.2 Answers\n\nThis is an experiment.\nThe treatment is exercise twice a week and control is no exercise.\nYes, the blocking variable is age.\nNo, the study is not blinded since the patients will know whether or not they are exercising.\nSince this is an experiment, we can make a causal statement. Since the sample is random, the causal statement can be generalized to the population at large. However, we should be cautious about making a causal statement because of a possible placebo effect.\nIt would be very difficult, if not impossible, to successfully conduct this study since randomly sampled people cannot be required to participate in a clinical trial"

    "section": "2.6 Textbook Chapter 2: Summarizing data",
    "text": "2.6 Textbook Chapter 2: Summarizing data\nThis week, we’ll look at numerical data, categorical data, and a case study.\n\n2.6.1 Numerical data\nThere are graphical and numerical methods for summarizing numerical data, including\n\nscatterplots\ndot plots\nmean\nhistograms\nvariance and standard deviation\nbox plots, quartiles, and the median\nrobust statistics\ncartographic maps and cartograms\n\nWe can draw a scatterplot of two variables of the loan50 data as follows.\n\noptions(repos=structure(c(CRAN=\"https://cran.microsoft.com/\")))\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nload(paste0(Sys.getenv(\"STATS_DATA_DIR\"),\"/loan50.rda\"))\nloan50 |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(annual_income,loan_amount)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\nThe above is a very basic scatterplot. Later, we’ll learn to change colors, background, labels, legends, and more. Bear in mind that the scatterplot is meant to compare two numeric variables. You can’t use it for a numeric variable and a categorical variable.\nWe can create a basic dotplot as follows.\n\nloan50 |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(homeownership)) +\n  geom_dotplot()\n\n\n\n\nA dotplot may be helpful to illustrate a categorical variable, but I seldom use them. Using them in concert with a boxplot may make more sense. We’ll look at boxplots later.\nThe mean is part of a good summary of data. We can find the mean of a variable by saying mean(variable_name) or as part of a summary. For instance\n\nwith(loan50,mean(annual_income))\n\n[1] 86170\n\nwith(loan50,summary(annual_income))\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. \n  28800   55750   74000   86170   99500  325000 \n\n\nNotice that the summary() function also gives us the minimum, the first quartile, the median, the 3rd quartile, and the maximum value of the variable, in addition to the mean. We’ll discuss all these statistics in the context of other ways to extract them. The problem with the mean that is demonstrated in the textbook is that two variables may have very different shapes but the same mean. So the textbook then describes histograms, which are a good way to identify the shape of a variable.\n\nloan50 |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(annual_income)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the x-axis labels are shown in scientific notation. We can fix this using the scales package. By the way, in case I haven’t mentioned it before, we always refer to the horizontal axis as the x-axis and the vertical axis as the y-axis. This is the default for r and many other languages that create graphical displays.\n\nlibrary(scales)\nloan50 |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(annual_income)) +\n  geom_histogram() +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = comma_format())\n\n\n\n\nYou may have noticed that Hadley Wickham, the inventor of the Tidyverse, dislikes the default number of bins in a histogram. So he programmed ggplot() to always show a warning message saying to pick a better number, depending on your data. We can fix that easily with a parameter to geom_histogram(). Then each bin (vertical stripe) will represent a thousand dollars.\n\nloan50 |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(annual_income)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth=1000) +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = comma_format())\n\n\n\n\nYou may notice that warning messages aren’t dealbreakers. An error message on the other hand, will often stop output dead in its tracks.\nThe next concepts covered in the textbook are variance and standard deviation. We can calculate them as follows. When you do this, you may notice that sd() is the square root of var(). Why would you prefer one over the other? Usually you use sd() because it’s in the same units as the data, dollars in the following case, unlike var(), which is in squared units, squared dollars in the following case.\n\nwith(loan50,var(annual_income))\n\n[1] 3e+09\n\nwith(loan50,sd(annual_income))\n\n[1] 57566\n\n\nTogether, the mean and standard deviation are often a good, yet compact, description of a data set.\nYou may want to find the means of all the columns in a data set. If you try to do that with the colMeans() function, you’ll get an error message as follows. (Actually, I’ve disabled the following code chunk by saying #| eval: false in the .qmd file because otherwise the rendering would halt.)\n\ncolMeans(loan50)\n\nThe remedy is to use a logical function to identify only the numeric columns.\n\ncolMeans(loan50[sapply(loan50, is.numeric)])\n\n             emp_length                    term           annual_income \n                     NA                   4e+01                   9e+04 \n         debt_to_income      total_credit_limit   total_credit_utilized \n                  7e-01                   2e+05                   6e+04 \nnum_cc_carrying_balance             loan_amount           interest_rate \n                  5e+00                   2e+04                   1e+01 \n public_record_bankrupt            total_income \n                  8e-02                   1e+05 \n\n\nThis is okay, but the results are in scientific notation. You can use the format() function to supress scientific notation as follows.\n\nformat(colMeans(loan50[sapply(loan50, is.numeric)]),scientific=FALSE)\n\n             emp_length                    term           annual_income \n            \"       NA\"             \"    42.72\"             \" 86170.00\" \n         debt_to_income      total_credit_limit   total_credit_utilized \n            \"     0.72\"             \"208546.64\"             \" 61546.54\" \nnum_cc_carrying_balance             loan_amount           interest_rate \n            \"     5.06\"             \" 17083.00\"             \"    11.57\" \n public_record_bankrupt            total_income \n            \"     0.08\"             \"105220.56\" \n\n\nNotice that you often wrap a function inside another function. The only problem is that it’s easy to lose track of all the parentheses.\nThe next topic in the textbook is the box plot. This also gives an opportunity to talk about the quartiles and the median. We can display a box plot as follows.\n\nloan50 |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(annual_income)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = comma_format())\n\n\n\n\nThe thick line in the middle of the box is the median, the middle value of the data set. The box itself is bound by the first and third quartiles, known as hinges. The full name of this construct is actually a box and whiskers plot and the lines extending horizontally from the box are called whiskers. The upper whisker extends from the hinge to the largest value no further than 1.5 * IQR from the hinge (where IQR is the inter-quartile range, or distance between the first and third quartiles). The lower whisker extends from the hinge to the smallest value at most 1.5 * IQR of the hinge. Data beyond the end of the whiskers are called “outlying” points and are plotted individually.\nWe often want to create several box plots and compare them. This is easy to do as follows.\n\nloan50 |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(annual_income,homeownership)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = comma_format())\n\n\n\n\nThe textbook’s next topic is Robust Statistics and we’re going to pretty much skip that for now, except to say that outliers, as shown in the textbook, can affect the value of some statistics more than others. The mean and median are a good example. The median is much more robust to outliers than is the mean, which can be dragged way up or down by the presence of just one or a few outliers, whereas the median can not. As a kind of thought experiment, consider the following data set and the addition of an outlier and the effect of the outlier on the mean and median.\n\nx&lt;-c(2,3,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,6,6)\nmean(x)\n\n[1] 4\n\nmedian(x)\n\n[1] 4\n\ny&lt;-c(2,3,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,6,6,800)\nmean(y)\n\n[1] 70\n\nmedian(y)\n\n[1] 4\n\n\nFinally, the chapter considers maps. There is a kind of map called a choropleth map that shows the value of a numeric variable in a geographic region. An example of density of French restaurants follows. First, here’s an open source map of Sagarmatha, aka Mount Everest, followed by one of London, followed by one of Austin. To get the bounding box for Austin, I used https://norbertrenner.de/osm/bbox.html.\n\nlibrary(ggmap)\nbbox_everest &lt;- c(left = 86.05, bottom = 27.21, right = 87.81, top = 28.76)\nggmap(get_stamenmap(bbox_everest, zoom = 9))\n\n\n\nbbox_london&lt;-c(-0.489,51.28,0.236,51.686)\nggmap(get_stamenmap(bbox_london))\n\n\n\nbbox_austin &lt;- c(-97.818,30.179,-97.604,30.336)\nggmap(get_stamenmap(bbox_austin,zoom=12))"

I will take off a lot of points if this happens when you turn in a graded assignment. I expect all files to be uniformly named.\nSeveral students left the boilerplate verbiage in their .qmd file. I will take off a lot of points if this happens when you turn in a graded assignment.\nOne student put their narrative inside the code chunks as R comments. Don’t do this. It undercuts the purpose of mixing narrative and code in a Quarto document.\nSome students didn’t try to answer the second part of question 1. One way to understand this is to draw a boxplot of the data, showing that there are four outliers at the top end, dragging the mean upward but leaving the median pretty much alone.\n\n\nloan50 |&gt; ggplot(aes(annual_income)) + geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\nSome students included graphics, which don’t show up in the copy on Canvas. One way to make these graphics show up is to add the following code to the front matter (the front matter is the stuff between two sets of three dashes at the beginning of the file):\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    embed-resources: true\nThe indentation shown above is essential for it to work.\n\nSome students highlighted relevant rows and columns as shown below.

    "text": "3.2 Week 03: More on R and Quarto\nI’ve established groups for the milestones. I’m open to moving you around if needed, subject to the constraint that we have no more than five members in a group. Currently we have six groups of five so, if you want to switch groups, you need to find someone in the other group who wants to switch to your group.\nI’ve added a bunch of files to the Files section on Canvas, pertaining to Milestone 1. You need to download these files. One of them (vehicles.csv) is quite large and time-consuming to download, so don’t wait.\n\n3.2.1 The template files\n\n\n3.2.2 Categorical Data\nThe template files show how you can begin the milestones. Notice that I have named the data frame as df in the template.qmd file. As a result, I can write functions like the following.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\ndf &lt;- read_csv(paste0(Sys.getenv(\"STATS_DATA_DIR\"),\"/vehicles.csv\"))\ndf |&gt; count(title_status,sort=TRUE)\n\n# A tibble: 7 × 2\n  title_status      n\n  &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;int&gt;\n1 clean        405117\n2 &lt;NA&gt;           8242\n3 rebuilt        7219\n4 salvage        3868\n5 lien           1422\n6 missing         814\n7 parts only      198\n\n\nThe above is a good way to investigate categorical data. Notice that I’ve used the pipe character, so that the data frame df is sent to the count() function. Then a particular categorical column of df is counted and sorted in descending numerical order. The count() function is part of the dplyr package, which is one of the tidyverse packages. You only need to load the tidyverse set of packages once in a document, preferably near the beginning.\nAnother point about the above result is that the count() function behaves different for large numbers of values. For example, region has 404 values. The count() function will just display the first and last 5 by default. I can make it work by adding the print fuction:\n\ndf |&gt; count(region,sort=TRUE) |&gt; print(n=404)\n\n# A tibble: 404 × 2\n    region                         n\n    &lt;chr&gt;

You have already made some of these using the table() function and some associated functions that are mentioned in the week02.qmd file. It will take some intuition to figure out which pairs of categorical columns should be tabulated for Milestone 1.\n\n\n3.2.3 Numerical Data\nFor numerical data, you can do what we did last week to investigate a single column.\n\nsummary(df$price)\n\n     Min.   1st Qu.    Median      Mean   3rd Qu.      Max. \n0.000e+00 5.900e+03 1.395e+04 7.520e+04 2.649e+04 3.737e+09 \n\n\nor\n\nlibrary(scales)\ndf$price &lt;- as.double(df$price)\ndf %&gt;%\n    summarize(Min=comma(min(price)),\n              firstq=comma(quantile(price,0.25)),\n              Median=comma(median(price)),\n              Mean=comma(mean(price)),\n              thirdq=comma(quantile(price,0.75)),\n              Max=comma(max(price)))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 6\n  Min   firstq Median Mean   thirdq Max          \n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;        \n1 0     5,900  13,950 75,199 26,486 3,736,928,711\n\ndf$price &lt;- as.integer(df$price)\n\nWarning: NAs introduced by coercion to integer range\n\n\nYou’ll notice that one of the prices is 3.7 billion dollars for a Toyota truck! This is obviously a misprint! You should probably remove this row from the data frame and save the data frame without it. A more sophisticated alternative would be to impute a value for this truck. There are many advanced statistical ways to do this, but they are beyond the scope of this course. van Buuren (2018) describes several excellent ways to do so, particularly in that book’s Section 5.1.1, Recommended Workflows. It is usually a mistake to use an average for missing (NA) values because to do so compresses the variance unnaturally. You may remove that particular row by saying df &lt;- df[-(which.max(df$price)),]. Unfortunately, you will find that not to be very useful because there are several prices of over a billion dollars for generic cars! In fact, there are several with prices listed as 1234567890 and some listed at 987654321. Many other ridiculous patterns can be found for price. So what can you do? Personally, I would add the following line right after reading in the file:\n\ndf &lt;- df[df$price&lt;100000&df$price&gt;0,]\n\nThis will rid the data frame of cars priced at greater than 100,000 dollars and still leave you with over 300,000 automobiles to analyze. Of course, there are will still be spurious entries, but at least it’s a start. The above code will also get rid of cars priced at exactly zero dollars. Examination of the data frame will show that many of the zero dollar entries are just ads for used car dealers. The expression price&lt;100000&price&gt;0 is called a compound Boolean expression. It is compound because of the ampersand, which stands for the word and. It means that the row has to contain a price less than 100,000 AND it also has to be a price greater than zero.\nBy the way, this is a good reminder that a data frame has a row and a column index. You can refer to rows by saying df[expression,] and to columns by saying df[,expression]. The expression can be any mathematical expression that resolves to TRUE or FALSE. The above expression resolves to TRUE for cars priced at greater than zero but less than 100,000 dollars, and FALSE for cars priced at any integer greater than or equal to 100,000. You can tell that price is a 64 bit integer by saying str(df) which will tell the structure of the df data frame. You should be able to see that most of the columns are classified as chr or character. This is not desirable. Most of the columns clasified as chr should more properly be classified as factors. Factors take up less space on your computer, are faster to process, and allow more types of processing than chr. Unfortunately, if you store your intermediate work as a .csv file, you will lose the factor designation. Therefore, I recommend that you do the following.\nStep 1. Get rid of rows you don’t want, such as those with prices over or under some threshold value you choose.\nStep 2. Get rid of columns you don’t want to analyze, such as url or VIN.\nStep 3. Convert some of the chr columns to factor. For instance, you can say df$state &lt;- as.factor(df$state).\nStep 4. Save your file by saying something like save(df,file=\"df.RData\")\nStep 5. Quit using this file and open a file called intermediate.qmd\nStep 6. At the beginning of that file, say load(\"df.RData\").\nStep 7. Do all your work in that file, then paste the work back into your template.qmd file so you can run it as required. (Remember, you are not turning in a .RData file. Your m1.qmd file must start with reading in the vehicles.csv file and do processing on the resulting data frame.)\nStep 8. Merge your template.qmd file with those of your group members into one m1.qmd file. For example, you could name all your individual template files with your names and one group member could merge them together. This should be easy for Milestone 1 since an obvious way to divide up your work is to assign different columns to different group members.\n\n\n3.2.4 Combining numerical and categorical selection\n\ndfX &lt;- subset(df,state %in% c(\"ca\",\"ny\") & type %in% c(\"sedan\",\"SUV\") & price&lt;99999 & price&gt;0)\ntbl &lt;- table(dfX$state,dfX$type)\naddmargins(tbl)\n\n     \n      sedan   SUV   Sum\n  ca  11086  7429 18515\n  ny   3747  3224  6971\n  Sum 14833 10653 25486\n\n\nAbove is an example of getting a small contingency table with only the data you want. The first line selects only cars offered in ca or ny, only sedans or SUVs, and only with prices below 99,999 dollars and more than zero dollars. Then we can make a compact contingency table of that new data frame and add the margins to it.\n\n\n3.2.5 Getting the data displayed as you wish\nSomeone asked me how to display price ranges by manufacturer. Here’s one way to do that:\n\ndf |&gt;\n  group_by(manufacturer) |&gt;\n  reframe(min = min(price),max=max(price)) |&gt;\n  print(n=43)\n\n# A tibble: 43 × 3\n   manufacturer      min        max\n   &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;int&gt;      &lt;int&gt;\n 1 acura               0     139999\n 2 alfa-romeo          0      62950\n 3 aston-martin        0     179888\n 4 audi                0     160000\n 5 bmw                 0  113456789\n 6 buick               0  123456789\n 7 cadillac            0     195000\n 8 chevrolet          NA         NA\n 9 chrysler            0     655000\n10 datsun              1      30000\n11 dodge               0    6995495\n12 ferrari             0     449500\n13 fiat                0      32500\n14 ford                0 1111111111\n15 gmc                 0  123456789\n16 harley-davidson     0      39900\n17 honda               0     123456\n18 hyundai             0      50000\n19 infiniti            0      69995\n20 jaguar              0     150000\n21 jeep                0 1410065407\n22 kia                 0      55325\n23 land rover          0      55000\n24 lexus               0     114950\n25 lincoln             0    1234567\n26 mazda               0      45000\n27 mercedes-benz      NA         NA\n28 mercury             0      95000\n29 mini                0      42500\n30 mitsubishi          0      40000\n31 morgan           1000      36500\n32 nissan              0  135008900\n33 pontiac             0     105000\n34 porsche             0     304995\n35 ram                 0   17000000\n36 rover               0     129888\n37 saturn              0    2000000\n38 subaru              0     195000\n39 tesla               0     104990\n40 toyota             NA         NA\n41 volkswagen          0     149000\n42 volvo               0 1234567890\n43 &lt;NA&gt;                0  123456789\n\n\nThe number 43 is because there are 43 manufacturers in the data frame. Note that, using the reframe() function, I could add a few more comma-separated statistics to the output.\n\n\n3.2.6 A function between numeric and visual\nMilestone 1 is supposed to be entirely about numeric descriptions of the data, not visual descriptions, which will be covered in Milestone 2. Yet there is one function that exists in a gray area between numeric and graphical. That is the stem and leaf plot. Consider the following output.\n\nstem(df$odometer)\n\n\n  The decimal point is 6 digit(s) to the right of the |\n\n  0 | 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000+421502\n  1 | 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000+562\n  2 | 000000000000000000111122223333333335555566666677789\n  3 | 02333357\n  4 | 0577777777\n  5 | 005556666666669\n  6 | 15\n  7 | 555678888888888888\n  8 | 04789999\n  9 | 000189\n  10 | 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000+58\n\n\nThe output does not need any graphical processor. It is only characters that can be included in text. Yet it is a kind of graphic because you can see, for instance, that of the cars have either very little mileage on the odometer or very much. Read it like this:\n\nThe stem is the vertical line.\nThe numbers to the left of the stem are, in this case, numbers in the sixth place to the left of the decimal point. In other words the first row represents zero to 999999.\nEach character to the right of the stem represents one car. There are probably 80 zeros in the first row.

It is the very first entry after the stem, represented as a zero. The next three entries are the cars that sell for the next lowest prices, between zero and 2 in the next decimal position. They are represented as 2s. You can see at a glance that, in this group of 100 cars, the lower odometer readings predominate. By the way, the stem() function discards NA values before processing the remainder. So there are only a total of 78 characters to the right of the stem on all the rows put together.\nThere is some difference of opinion as to whether stem() is graphical or numerical.

It states, in words, that the posterior probability of an outcome \\(A\\) given an outcome \\(B\\) is the likelihood of the outcome \\(B\\) times the prior probability of the outcome \\(A\\) divided by the evidence of outcome \\(B\\). More succinctly,\n\\[\nP(A|B)=\\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}\n\\]\nThe intuition is that we usually know something and shouldn’t go into problem solving with no assumptions. An example of drug user testing given by Wikipedia is shown below graphically, where the test is ninety percent sensitive to a recipient being a drug user. The test is also eighty percent specific, meaning that it can detect that a non-user is a non-user eighty percent of the time.\n\nWhat does this tell us about drug testing? Even if someone tests positive, the probability that they are a drug user is only 19%! This assumes prior knowledge that five percent of the general population are users of the drug.\nIn Bayesian terms:\n\\[\n\\frac{0.9 \\times 0.05}{0.9\\times 0.05 + 0.2\\times0.95}\n\\] By the way, this formulation uses the law of total probability in the denominator, expanding \\(P(B)\\) into\n\\[\nP(B|A)P(A)+P(B|\\neg A)P(\\neg A)\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\neg A\\) is the complement of \\(A\\).\nThis is very important to know about because, for example, someone might only tell you that a test is ninety percent sensitive and eighty percent specific and leave out the Bayes rule result that says that, given that only five percent of the general population are drug users, there’s a nineteen percent chance that testing positive indicates that you are a drug user. Again, Bayes’ rule is very important when you have some prior knowledge. In this case, the prior knowledge is a study that says that five percent of the general population are users of this drug."

The probability that a random variable \\(X\\) has a specific outcome \\(x_1\\) is represented as \\(P(X=x_1)\\).\nThe expectation of \\(X\\) is the expected value of \\(X\\), represented as \\(E(X)\\). The expected value is typically the average, but not always. If there are \\(k\\) possible outcomes, then\n\\[\nE(X)=\\sum_{i=1}^kx_iP(X=x_i)\n\\]\nThe Greek letter \\(\\sum\\) (Sigma) denotes a sum of a series of numbers, indexed in this case by \\(i\\). You can read it in English as the sum, going from \\(1\\) to \\(k\\), of the expressions to the right of the Sigma sign. In other words,\n\\[\nx_1P(X=x_1)+x_1P(X=x_1)+\\cdots+x_kP(X=x_k)\n\\]\nIt’s the average as we usually understand it if each outcome is equally probable, in which case it’s the sum of the outcomes divided by the number of outcomes.\nWriters often substitute \\(E(X)=\\mu\\) which can be confusing because Greek letters are usually used as parameters, while Latin letters are usually used as specific realizations of those parameters.\nThe above assumes there are \\(k\\) specific outcomes. We call this case a discrete random variable. It’s also possible to do math with a continuous random variable. In other words, \\(k=\\infty\\). However, that requires calculus so the textbook skips it for now.\n\n4.18.1 Variability in random variables\nRecall that random variables are a kind of mapping between a process and specific numerical outcomes. Those specific outcomes differ. For example, the revenue of a store varies day by day, and we can say something about that variability.\nWe usually express it by two related concepts: variance (denoted by a lowercase sigma squared or \\(\\sigma^2\\)), and its square root, standard deviation (denoted by a lowercase sigma or \\(\\sigma\\)). You might wonder why we don’t just choose one of these symbols. Most statisticians just use standard deviation, but to prove that it is an unbiased estimator of variance, we need to square it for mathematical reasons that are beyond the scope of this course.\nStandard deviation is expressed in the same units as the subject under consideration, whereas variance is expressed in squared units. So when I said at the beginning of this file that the standard deviation of your completed exercises was about 2.69, I meant that in terms of number of exercises, meaning that most of you were within 2.69 completed exercises either way of each other. In other words, if you had three or nine completed exercises, you were a kind of outlier.\n\n\n4.18.2 Linear combinations of random variables\nWe can put random variables together. For example, your GPA is calculated from a set of grades that may differ. If you play fantasy sports, your score comes from many different players. A recommender system for music listening may make calculations based on many different songs you listened to.\nA linear combination of two random variables can be expressed as \\(aX+bY\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are fixed constants, for example, the number of credits applied to each class in your GPA portfolio. If you take four four credit classes, your GPA might be expressed as the linear combination\n\\[\n4E(X_1)+4E(X_2)+4E(X_3)+4E(X_4)\n\\]\nwhere \\(E(X_i)\\) is a function of your grade, such as your grade mapped to a number and divided by the number of credits you’re taking. (Of course, you are used to thinking of it as the average of the grades since most classes carry the same number of credits and your grades are mapped to numbers. But this formulation holds for all kinds of sets.)"

    "section": "4.19 Continuous distributions",
    "text": "4.19 Continuous distributions\nSo far, we’ve considered discrete distributions, where \\(k\\) takes on one of a finite set of values. What about the continuous case? For example, temperature can theoretically take on an infinite number of values, even though we only have the tools for discrete measurements.\nThe most famous continuous distribution is the normal distribution. This picture illustrates the normal distribution. The mound-shaped curve represents the probability density function and the area between the curve and the horizontal line represents the value of the cumulative distribution function.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider a normally distributed nationwide test.\nThe total shaded area between the curve and the straight horizontal line can be thought of as one hundred percent of that area. In the world of probability, we measure that area as 1. The curve is symmetrical, so measure all the area to the left of the highest point on the curve as 0.5. That is half, or fifty percent, of the total area between the curve and the horizontal line at the bottom. Instead of saying area between the curve and the horizontal line at the bottom, people usually say the area under the curve.\nFor any value along the \\(x\\)-axis, the \\(y\\)-value on the curve represents the value of the probability density function.\nThe area bounded by the vertical line between the \\(x\\)-axis and the corresponding \\(y\\)-value on the curve, though, is what we are usually interested in because that area represents probability.\nHere is a graph of the size of that area. It’s called the cumulative distribution function (cdf).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above graph can be read as having an input and output that correspond to the previous graph of the probability density function. As we move from right to left on the \\(x\\)-axis, the area that would be to the left of a given point on the probability density function is the \\(y\\)-value on this graph. For example, if we go half way across the \\(x\\)-axis of the probability density function, the area to its left is one half of the total area, so the \\(y\\)-value on the cumulative distribution function graph is one half.\nThe shape of the cumulative distribution function is called a sigmoid curve. You can see how it gets this shape by looking again at the probability density function graph above. As you move from left to right on that graph, the area under the curve increases very slowly, then more rapidly, then slowly again. The places where the area grows more rapidly and then more slowly on the probability density function curve correspond to the s-shaped bends on the cumulative distribution curve.\nAt the left side of the cumulative distribution curve, the \\(y\\)-value is zero meaning zero probability. When we reach the right side of the cumulative distribution curve, the \\(y\\)-value is 1 or 100 percent of the probability.\nLet’s get back to the example of a nationwide test. If we say that students nationwide took an test that had a mean score of 75 and that the score was normally distributed, we’re saying that the value on the \\(x\\)-axis in the center of the curve is 75. Moreover, we’re saying that the area to the left of 75 is one half of the total area. We’re saying that the probability of a score less than 75 is 0.5 or fifty percent. We’re saying that half the students got a score below 75 and half got a score above 75.\nThat is called the frequentist interpretation of probability. In general, that interpretation says that a probability of 0.5 is properly measured by saying that, if we could repeat the event enough times, we would find the event happening half of those times.\nFurthermore, the frequentist interpretation of the normal distribution is that, if we could collect enough data, such as administering the above test to thousands of students, we would see that the graph of the frequency of their scores would look more and more like the bell curve in the picture, where \\(x\\) is a test score and \\(y\\) is the number of students receiving that score.\nSuppose we have the same test and the same distribution but that the mean score is 60. Then 60 is in the middle and half the students are on each side. That is easy to measure. But what if, in either case, we would like to know the probability associated with scores that are not at that convenient midpoint?\nIt’s hard to measure any other area under the normal curve except for \\(x\\)-values in the middle of the curve, corresponding to one half of the area. Why is this?\nTo see why it’s hard to measure the area corresponding to any value except the middle value, let’s first consider a different probability distribution, the uniform distribution. Suppose I have a machine that can generate any number between 0 and 1 at random. Further, suppose that any such number is just as likely as any other such number.\nHere’s a graph of the the uniform distribution of numbers generated by the machine. The horizontal line is the probability density function and the shaded area is the cumulative distribution function from 0 to 1/2. In other words, the probability of the machine generating numbers from 0 to 1/2 is 1/2. The probability of generating numbers from 0 to 1 is 1, the area of the entire rectangle.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s very easy to calculate any probability for this distribution, in contrast to the normal distribution. The reason it is easy is that you can just use the formula for the area of a rectangle, where area is base times side. The probability of being in the entire rectangle is \\(1\\times1=1\\), and the probability of being in the part from \\(x=0\\) to \\(x=1/4\\) is just \\(1\\times(1/4)=1/4\\). The cumulative distribution function of the uniform distribution is simpler than that of the normal distribution because area is being added at the same rate as we move from left to right on the above graph. Therefore it is just a straight diagonal line from (0,1) on the left to (1,1) on the right.\n\n\n\n\n\nReading it is the same as reading the cumulative distribution function for the normal distribution. For any value on the \\(x\\)-axis, say, 1/2, go up to the diagonal line and over to the value on the \\(y\\)-axis. In this case, that value is 1/2. That is the area under the horizontal line in the probability density function graph from 0 to 1/2 (the shaded area). For a rectangle, calculating area is trivial.\nCalculating the area of a curved region like the normal distribution can be more difficult. If you’ve studied any calculus, you know that there are techniques for calculating the area under a curve. These techniques are called integration techniques. In the case of the normal distribution the formula for the height of the curve at any point on the \\(x\\)-axis is\n\\[\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}}e^{-(x-\\mu)^2/2\\sigma^2}\n\\end{equation*}\\]\nand the area is the integral of that quantity from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(x\\), which can be rewritten as\n\\[\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\int^x_{-\\infty}e^{-t^2/2}dt\n=(1/2)\\left(1+\\text{erf}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2}}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{equation*}\\]\nThe integral on the left is difficult to evaluate so people use numerical approximation techniques to find the expression on the right in the above equation. Those techniques are so time-consuming that, rather than recompute them every time they are needed, a very few people used to write the results into a table and publish it and most people working with probability would just consult the tables. Only in the past few decades have calculators become available that can do the tedious approximations. Hence, most statistics books, written by people who were educated decades ago, still teach you how to use such tables. There is some debate as to whether there is educational value in using the tables vs using calculators or smartphone apps or web-based tables or apps."

What is the probability that someone will score lower than you?\n\npnorm(1100,mean=1100,sd=200)\n\n[1] 0.5\n\n\nThis returns a value of 0.5 or fifty percent.

Here, we standardize by recognizing that \\(Z=(x-\\mu)/\\sigma\\) or \\((1190-1100)/200=0.45\\) and then we can say\n\n1 - pnorm(0.45,mean=0,sd=1)\n\n[1] 0.3263552\n\n\nand we get the same answer as above, 32.64 percent."

    "text": "6.6 normal distribution\nThis picture illustrates the normal distribution. The mound-shaped curve represents the probability density function and the area between the curve and the horizontal line represents the value of the cumulative distribution function.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider a normally distributed nationwide test.\nThe total shaded area between the curve and the straight horizontal line can be thought of as one hundred percent of that area. In the world of probability, we measure that area as 1. The curve is symmetrical, so measure all the area to the left of the highest point on the curve as 0.5. That is half, or fifty percent, of the total area between the curve and the horizontal line at the bottom. Instead of saying area between the curve and the horizontal line at the bottom, people usually say the area under the curve.\nFor any value along the \\(x\\)-axis, the \\(y\\)-value on the curve represents the value of the probability density function.\nThe area bounded by the vertical line between the \\(x\\)-axis and the corresponding \\(y\\)-value on the curve, though, is what we are usually interested in because that area represents probability.\nHere is a graph of the size of that area. It’s called the cumulative distribution function.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above graph can be read as having an input and output that correspond to the previous graph of the probability density function. As we move from right to left on the \\(x\\)-axis, the area that would be to the left of a given point on the probability density function is the \\(y\\)-value on this graph. For example, if we go half way across the \\(x\\)-axis of the probability density function, the area to its left is one half of the total area, so the \\(y\\)-value on the cumulative distribution function graph is one half.\nThe shape of the cumulative distribution function is called a sigmoid curve. You can see how it gets this shape by looking again at the probability density function graph above. As you move from left to right on that graph, the area under the curve increases very slowly, then more rapidly, then slowly again. The places where the area grows more rapidly and then more slowly on the probability density function curve correspond to the s-shaped bends on the cumulative distribution curve.\nAt the left side of the cumulative distribution curve, the \\(y\\)-value is zero meaning zero probability. When we reach the right side of the cumulative distribution curve, the \\(y\\)-value is 1 or 100 percent of the probability.\nLet’s get back to the example of a nationwide test. If we say that students nationwide took an test that had a mean score of 75 and that the score was normally distributed, we’re saying that the value on the \\(x\\)-axis in the center of the curve is 75. Moreover, we’re saying that the area to the left of 75 is one half of the total area. We’re saying that the probability of a score less than 75 is 0.5 or fifty percent. We’re saying that half the students got a score below 75 and half got a score above 75.\nThat is called the frequentist interpretation of probability. In general, that interpretation says that a probability of 0.5 is properly measured by saying that, if we could repeat the event enough times, we would find the event happening half of those times.\nFurthermore, the frequentist interpretation of the normal distribution is that, if we could collect enough data, such as administering the above test to thousands of students, we would see that the graph of the frequency of their scores would look more and more like the bell curve in the picture, where \\(x\\) is a test score and \\(y\\) is the number of students receiving that score.\nSuppose we have the same test and the same distribution but that the mean score is 60. Then 60 is in the middle and half the students are on each side. That is easy to measure. But what if, in either case, we would like to know the probability associated with scores that are not at that convenient midpoint?\nIt’s hard to measure any other area under the normal curve except for \\(x\\)-values in the middle of the curve, corresponding to one half of the area. Why is this?\nTo see why it’s hard to measure the area corresponding to any value except the middle value, let’s first consider a different probability distribution, the uniform distribution. Suppose I have a machine that can generate any number between 0 and 1 at random. Further, suppose that any such number is just as likely as any other such number.\nHere’s a graph of the the uniform distribution of numbers generated by the machine. The horizontal line is the probability density function and the shaded area is the cumulative distribution function from 0 to 1/2. In other words, the probability of the machine generating numbers from 0 to 1/2 is 1/2. The probability of generating numbers from 0 to 1 is 1, the area of the entire rectangle.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s very easy to calculate any probability for this distribution, in contrast to the normal distribution. The reason it is easy is that you can just use the formula for the area of a rectangle, where area is base times side. The probability of being in the entire rectangle is \\(1\\times1=1\\), and the probability of being in the part from \\(x=0\\) to \\(x=1/4\\) is just \\(1\\times(1/4)=1/4\\).\nThe cumulative distribution function of the uniform distribution is simpler than that of the normal distribution because area is being added at the same rate as we move from left to right on the above graph. Therefore it is just a straight diagonal line from (0,1) on the left to (1,1) on the right.\n\n\n\n\n\nReading it is the same as reading the cumulative distribution function for the normal distribution. For any value on the \\(x\\)-axis, say, 1/2, go up to the diagonal line and over to the value on the \\(y\\)-axis. In this case, that value is 1/2. That is the area under the horizontal line in the probability density function graph from 0 to 1/2 (the shaded area). For a rectangle, calculating area is trivial.\nCalculating the area of a curved region, like the normal distribution, though, can be more difficult. If you’ve studied any calculus, you know that there are techniques for calculating the area under a curve. These techniques are called integration techniques. In the case of the normal distribution the formula for the height of the curve at any point on the \\(x\\)-axis is \\[\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}}e^{-(x-\\mu)^2/2\\sigma^2}\n\\end{equation*}\\] and the area is the integral of that quantity from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(x\\), which can be rewritten as \\[\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\int^x_{-\\infty}e^{-t^2/2}dt\n=(1/2)\\left(1+\\text{erf}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2}}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{equation*}\\] The integral on the left is difficult to evaluate so people use numerical approximation techniques to find the expression on the right in the above equation. Those techniques are so time-consuming that, rather than recompute them every time they are needed, a very few people used to write the results into a table and publish it and most people working with probability would just consult the tables. Only in the past few decades have calculators become available that can do the tedious approximations. Hence, most statistics books, written by people who were educated decades ago, still teach you how to use such tables. There is some debate as to whether there is educational value in using the tables vs using calculators or smartphone apps or web-based tables or apps. We’ll demonstrate them and assume that you use a calculator or smartphone app on exams.\n\n6.6.1 Using the normal distribution\nSince there is no convenient integration formula, people used tables until recently. Currently you can google tables or apps that do the work of tables. We’re going to do two exercises with tables that help give you an idea of what’s going on. You can use your calculator afterward. The main reason for what follows is so you understand the results produced by your calculator to avoid ridiculous mistakes.\n\n\n6.6.2 calculating z scores\n\\[z=\\frac{y-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\]\nCalculations use the fact that the bell curve is symmetric and adds up to 1, so you can calculate one side and add it, subtract it, or double it\nFollowing are four examples.\n\n\\(P(-1 \\leqslant z \\leqslant 1)\\): Since the bell curve is symmetric, find the area from \\(z=0\\) to \\(z=1\\) and double that area. The table entry for \\(z=1\\) gives the relevant area under the curve, .3413. Doubling this gives the area from -1 to 1: .6826. Using a calculator may give you .6827 since a more accurate value than that provided by the table would be .6826895. This is an example where no points would be deducted from your score for using either answer.\n\\(P(-1.96 \\leqslant z \\leqslant 1.96)\\): This is one of the three most common areas of interest in this course, the other two being the one in part (c) below and the one I will add on after I show part (d) below. Here again, we can read the value from the table as .4750 and double it, giving .95. This is really common because because 95% is the most commonly used confidence interval.\n\\(P(-1.645 \\leqslant z \\leqslant 1.645)\\): The table does not have an entry for this extremely commonly desired value. A statistical calculator or software package will show that the result is .45, which can be doubled to give .90, another of the three most frequently used confidence intervals. If you use interpolation, you will get the correct answer in this case. Interpolation means to take the average of the two closest values, in this case \\((.4495+ .4505) / 2\\). You will rarely, if ever need to use interpolation in real life because software has made the tables obsolete and we only use them to try to drive home the concept of \\(z\\)-scores relating to area under the curve, rather than risking the possibility that you learn to punch numbers into an app without understanding them. Our hope is that, by first learning this method, you will be quick to recognize the results of mistakes, rather than naively reporting wacky results like the probability is 1.5 just because you typed a wrong number.\n\\(P(-3 \\leqslant z \\leqslant 3)\\): The table gives .4987 and doubling that gives .9974. A calculator would give the more correct (but equally acceptable in this course) result of .9973.\n\nThe other common confidence interval I mentioned above is the 99% confidence interval, used in cases where the calculation relates to something life-threatening, such as a question involving a potentially life-saving drug or surgery. A table or calculator will show that the \\(z\\)-score that would lead to this result is 2.576. So if you were asked to compute \\(P(-2.576 \\leqslant z \\leqslant 2.576)\\), the correct answer would be .99 or 99%. To use a calculator or statistical app to find the \\(z\\)-score given the desired probability, you would look in an app for something called a quantile function.\n\n\n6.6.3 sketch the graphs of probabilities\nSketch the normal curve six times, identifying a different region on it each time. For these graphs, let \\(y\\sim N(100,8)\\)."

The central limit theorem means that resampling the mean of any of these distributions can be done on a large scale using the normal distribution assumptions without regard to the underlying distribution. This simplifies many real-life calculations. For instance, waiting times at each bus stop are exponentially distributed but if we take the mean waiting time at each of 100 bus stops, the mean of those 100 times is normally distributed, even though the individual waiting times are drawn from an exponential distribution.\n\n\n\n\n6.7.3 normal distribution example problem\nConsider an example for calculating a \\(z\\)-score where \\(x\\sim N(50,15)\\), which is a statistical notation for saying \\(x\\) is a random normal variable with mean 50 and standard deviation 15. It is also read as if you said that \\(x\\) has the normal distribution with mean 50 and standard deviation 15.\n\n6.7.3.1 Picture the example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.7.3.2 Here’s what we input into the \\(z\\) calculation.\nIn order to identify the size of the shaded area, we can use the table of \\(z\\)-scores by standardizing the parameters we believe to apply, as if they were the population parameters \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\). We only do this if we have such a large sample that we have reason to believe that the sample values approach the population parameters. For the much, much more typical case where we have a limited amount of data, we’ll learn a more advanced technique that you will use much more frequently in practice.\n\n\n6.7.3.3 We input a \\(z\\) to get an output probability.\nThe table in our textbook contains an input in the left and top margins and an output in the body. The input is a \\(z\\)-score, the result of the calculation \\[z=\\frac{y-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\] where \\(z\\geq 0\\). The output is a number in the body of the table, expressing the probability for the area between the normal curve and the axis, from the mean (0) to \\(z\\). Note that the values of \\(z\\) start at the mean and grow toward the right end of the graph. If \\(z\\) were \\(\\infty\\), the shaded area would be 0.5, also known as 50 percent.\n\n\n6.7.3.4 This is the \\(z\\)-score table concept.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.7.3.5 Calculate the \\(z\\)-score to input.\nFor now, let’s calculate the \\(z\\)-score as \\[z=\\frac{y-\\mu}{\\sigma}=\\frac{70-50}{15}=1.33\\] giving half of the answer we’re seeking:"

    "text": "6.8 Apply the \\(z\\)-score to the table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.8.0.1 Obtain an intermediate result.\nNow use this to read the table. The input is 1.33 and you’ll use the left and top margins to find it. The output is the corresponding entry in the body of the table, .4082, also known as 40.82 percent of the area under the curve.\n\n\n6.8.0.2 Finish the example.\nRecall that our initial problem was to find \\(P(30&lt;y&lt;70)\\) and what we’ve just found, .4082, is \\(P(50&lt;y&lt;70)\\). We must multiply this result by 2 to obtain the correct answer, .8164 or 81.64 percent. That is to say that the probability that \\(y\\) is somewhere between 30 and 70 is .8164 or 81.64 percent. As a reality check, all probabilities for any single event must sum to 1, and the total area under the curve is 1, so it is a relief to note that the answer we’ve found is less than 1. It’s also comforting to note that the shaded area in the original picture of the example looks like it could plausibly represent about 80 percent of the total area. It is easy to get lost in the mechanics of calculations and come up with a wildly incorrect answer because of a simple arithmetic error.\n\n\n6.8.1 Some \\(z\\)-score tables differ from ours.\nBear in mind that anyone can publish a \\(z\\)-score table using their own customs. Students have found such tables that define \\(z\\) as starting at the extreme left of the curve. If we used such a table for the above example, the output would have been .9082 instead of .4082 and we would have had to subtract the left side, .5, from that result before multiplying by 2.\n\n\n6.8.2 typical exam questions for \\(z\\)-scores\nMany exam-style problems will ask questions such that you must do more or less arithmetic with the result from the table. Consider these questions, still using the above example where \\(y\\sim N(50,15)\\):\n\nWhat is the probability that \\(y\\) is greater than 50?\nWhat is the probability that \\(y\\) is greater than 70?\nWhat is the probability that \\(y\\) is less than 30?\nWhat is the probability that \\(y\\) is between 30 and 50?\n\n\n6.8.2.1 Answer the preceding questions.\nEach of these questions can be answered using \\(z=1.33\\) except the first. Since we know that \\(y\\) is normally distributed, we also know that the probability of \\(y\\) being greater than its mean is one half, so the answer to the first question is 0.5 or fifty percent. The second question simply requires us to subtract the result from the table, .4082, from .5 to find the area to the right of 1.33, which is .0918 or 9.18 percent. The third question is symmetrical with the second, so we can just use the method from the second question to find that it is also .0918. Similarly, the fourth question is symmetrical with the first step from the book example, so the answer is the answer to that first step, .4082.\n\n\n6.8.2.2 This one takes an extra step.\nWhat is the probability that \\(y\\) is between 30 and 40?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.8.2.3 Find the difference between areas.\nSubtract the probability that \\(y\\) is between 50 and 60 from the probability that \\(y\\) is between 50 and 70.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.8.3 How do you find areas in \\(z\\)-score tables?\n\ndraw picture to help you understand the question\nstandardize the picture so you can use a table or a\ndraw the standardized picture\npick one of three kinds of tables / apps\nwrite the standardized result (may do this multiple times)\nfit the standardized result(s) into the original problem\n\nLet’s look at these steps with an example. Suppose that \\(y\\sim N(50,8)\\). In words, this means that \\(y\\) has the normal distribution with true mean 50 and true standard deviation 8. Let’s answer the question What’s the probability that \\(y&gt;40\\)?\nStep 1 is to draw a picture to make sense of the question. The picture shows the area under the curve where the scale marking is to the right of 40. This picture tells you right away that the number that will answer the question is less than 1 (the entire curve would be shaded if it were 1) and more than 1/2 (the portion to the right of 50 would be 1/2 and we have certainly shaded more than that).\nStep 2 is to standardize the question so we can use a table or app to find the probability / area. We use the equation \\(z=(y-\\mu)/\\sigma\\) with values from the original question: \\((50-40)/8=-10/8=-1.25\\). Now we know the labels that would go on a standardized picture similar to the picture above. Now we can ask the standardized question What’s the probability that \\(z&gt;-1.25\\)?\nStep 3 is to draw that standardized picture. It’s the same as the picture above except standardized so that it fits the tables / apps for calculating probability / area. Now, instead of \\(y\\) we’re looking for \\(z\\) and the probability associated with \\(z\\) on a standardized table will be the same as for \\(y\\) on a table for the parameters given in the original question.\nStep 4 is to pick one of the three kinds of tables / apps to input the standardized \\(z\\) score to get a probability as output. In this example, we only have to do this step once because we only want to know the area greater than \\(y\\). If we wanted to know a range between two \\(y\\) values, we’d need the \\(z\\) scores for each of them so we’d have to do it twice.\nThe three kinds of output from tables / apps are as follows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first figure shows how the table works in some books. It provides the value from 0 to \\(|z|\\). If \\(z\\) is negative, using this table requires you to input \\(|z|\\) instead. In this question, the value you get will be .3944. To get the ultimate answer to this question, Step 5 will be to add this value to .5, giving a final answer of .8944.\nThe second figure shows how most tables and apps work. It gives the value from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(z\\). In this question, the value you get will be .1056. To get the ultimate answer to this question, Step 5 will be to subtract this value from 1, giving a final answer of .8944.\nThe bottom figure shows how some tables and apps work. It gives the value from z to \\(+\\infty\\). In this question, the value you get will be .8944. To get the ultimate answer to this question, Step 5 will be to simply report this value, giving a final answer of .8944.\nNotice that all three types of tables / apps lead to the same result by different paths. In this case, the right figure is the most convenient but, for other questions, one of the others may be more convenient.\nStep 5, the final step is to use the value you got from a table or app in conjunction with the original picture you drew in Step 1. Since the procedure for step 5 depends on the table / app you use, I gave the procedure for Step 5 above in the paragraphs for top, middle, and bottom figure."

The average of the ten samples is 17. The sum of the squares of the sample is 3281. What is their standard deviation?\n\n6.10.1.1 Recognize appropriate formulas.\nThe information in the problem statement hints that you should use \\[s=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i^2 -\nn(\\overline{y})^2}{n-1}}\\] so you write \\[s=\\sqrt{\\frac{3281 - 10(17)^2}{10-1}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{3281-2890}{9}}=\\sqrt{43.4444}=6.5912\\]\n\n\n6.10.1.2 Why was the subtraction result positive?\nThe sample of ten gas mileage estimates is 17, 18, 16, 20, 14, 17, 21, 13, 22, 12, 17. The sum of their squares is inevitably larger than or equal to the mean squared times the number of values. The easiest way to see this is to use a series of identical values. Hence, finding the sum of the squares is the same as calculating the mean squared times the number of values. There is no variance at all in such a sample, so it makes sense to arrive at a standard deviation of zero. Is there any way to alter such a sample so that the sum of the squared values falls below the mean? No.\n\n\n6.10.1.3 What should you do when you don’t understand?\nThe previous example was developed as an answer to the question, what do I do if I need to do a negative square root? You can figure out that you will never need to do so by the preceding process of finding a way to make \\(\\sum y_i^2 = n(\\overline{y}^2)\\) and then trying to alter the values to decrease the left side or increase the right side."

    "text": "6.11 Make an inference about a population parameter.\nAt the beginning of the course, I said that statistics describes data and makes inferences about data. This course is partly about the latter, making inferences. You can make two kinds of inferences about a population parameter: estimate it or test a hypothesis about it.\n\n6.11.1 First distinguish between small and large.\nYou may have a small sample or a large sample. The difference in the textbook is typically given as a cutoff of 30. Less is small, more is large. Other cutoffs are given, but this is the most prevalent.\nLarge samples with a normal distribution can be used to estimate a population mean using a \\(z\\)-score. Small samples can be used to estimate a population mean using a \\(t\\)-statistic.\n\n\n6.11.2 Sampling leads to a new statistic.\nIf we take more and more samples from a given population, the variability of the samples will decrease. This relationship gives rise to the standard error of an estimate \\[\\sigma_{\\overline{y}}=\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\]\nThe standard error of the estimate is not exactly the standard deviation. It is the standard deviation divided by a function of the sample size and it shrinks as the sample size grows."

Find out by calculating that interval.

The Greek letter \\(\\nu\\), pronounced nyoo, represents the number of degrees of freedom.\n\n\n6.12.3 Find a probability to estimate a mean.\nEstimating a mean involves finding a region where the mean is likely to be. The first question to ask is how likely? and to do so, we use a concept called alpha, denoted by the Greek letter \\(\\alpha\\). Traditionally, people have used three values of \\(\\alpha\\) for the past century, .10, .05, and .01. These correspond to regions of \\(1-\\alpha\\) under the normal distribution curve, so these regions are 90 percent of the area, 95 percent of the area, and 99 percent of the area. What we are saying, for instance, if \\(\\alpha=0.01\\) is that we are 99 percent confident that the true population mean lies within the region we’ve calculated, \\(\\overline{y}\\pm 2.576\\sigma_{\\overline{y}}\\)\n\n\n6.12.4 \\(\\alpha\\) selection is driven by criticality.\nTraditionally, \\(\\alpha=0.01\\) is used in cases where life could be threatened by failure.\nTraditionally, \\(\\alpha=0.05\\) is used in cases where money is riding on the outcome.\nTraditionally, \\(\\alpha=0.10\\) is used in cases where the consequences of failing to capture the true mean are not severe.\n\nThe above picture shows these three cases. The top version, life-or-death, has the smallest rejection region. Suppose the test is whether a radical cancer treatment gives longer life than a traditional cancer treatment. Let’s say that the traditional treatment gives an average of 15 months longer life. The null hypothesis is that the new treatment also gives 15 months longer life. The alternative hypothesis is that the radical treatment gives 22 months more life on average based on on only five patients who received the new treatment. A patient can only do one treatment or the other. The status quo would be to take the traditional treatment unless there is strong evidence that the radical treatment provides an average longer life. In the following picture, the shaded area is where the test statistic would have to fall for us to say that there is strong evidence that the radical treatment provides longer life. We want to make that shaded region as small as possible so we minimize the chance our test statistic lands in it by mistake.\nWe can afford to let that shaded area be bigger (increasing the chance of mistakenly landing in it) if only money, not life, is riding on the outcome. And we can afford to let it be bigger still if the consequences of the mistake are small. To choose an \\(\\alpha\\) level, ask yourself how severe are the consequences of a Type I error.\n\n\n6.12.5 practice estimating a population mean\nConsider an outlet store that purchased used display panels to refurbish and resell. The relevant statistics for failure time of the sample are \\(n=50, \\overline{y}=1.9350, s=0.92865\\).\nBut these are the only necessary numbers to solve the problem. The standard error, .1313 can be calculated from \\(s/\\sqrt{n} = 0.92865/\\sqrt{50}=.1313.\\)\nFirst, find the 95% confidence interval, which can be calculated from the above information. Since the sample is greater than or equal to 30, we use the large sample formula: \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\overline{y}\\pm z_{\\alpha/2} \\sigma_{\\overline{y}} \\approx \\overline{y}\\pm z_{\\alpha/2} \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\n&= 1.9350 \\pm 1.96 (.1313) \\\\\n&= 1.9350 \\pm 0.2573 \\\\\n&= (1.6777,2.1932)\n\\end{align*}\\] The correct answer to a question asking for the confidence interval is simply that pair of numbers, 1.6777 and 2.1932.\nNow interpret that. This result says that we are 95% confident that the true average time to failure for these panels is somewhere between 1.6777 years and 2.1932 years. It is tempting to rephrase the result. Be careful that you don’t say something with a different meaning. Suppose the store wants to offer a warranty on these panels. Knowing that we are 95% confident that the true mean is in the given range helps the store evaluate the risk of different warranty lengths. The correct answer is to say that we are 95% confident that the true mean time to failure for these panels is somewhere between 1.6777 years and 2.1932 years.\nThe meaning of the 95 percent confidence interval is that, if we repeatedly resample the population, computing a 95% confidence interval for each sample, we expect 95% of the confidence intervals generated to capture the true mean.\nAny statistics software can also offer a graphical interpretation, such as a stem-and-leaf plot or histogram. The stem-and-leaf plot uses the metaphor of a stem bearing some number of leaves. In the following stem-and-leaf plot, the stem represents the first digit of a two-digit number. The top row of the plot has the stem 0 and two leaves, 0 and 2. Each leaf represents a data point as the second digit of a two-digit number. If you count the leaves (the digits to the right of the vertical bar), you will see that there are fifty of them, one for each recorded failure time. You can think of each stem as holding all the leaves in a certain range. The top stem holds all the leaves in the range .00 to .04 and there are two of them. The next stem holds the six leaves in the range .05 to .09. The third stem holds all six leaves in the range .10 to .15. The stem-and-leaf plot resembles a sideways bar chart and helps us see that the distribution of the failure times is somewhat mound-shaped. The main advantages of the stem-and-leaf plot are that it is compact for the amount of information it conveys and that it does not require a graphics program or even a computer to quickly construct it from the raw data. The programming website http://rosettacode.org uses the stem-and-leaf plot as a programming task, demonstrating how to create one in 37 different programming languages.\n0 | 02\n0 | 567788\n1 | 122222\n1 | 55666667888999\n2 | 0223344\n2 | 666788\n3 | 00233\n3 | 5555\nMost statistics programs offer many different histogram types.

    "text": "6.14 test a hypothesis about a sample mean\nThe test statistic is \\(t_c\\), where the \\(c\\) subscript stands for calculated. Most people just call it \\(t\\). In my mind, that leads to occasional confusion about whether it is a value calculated from a sample. We’ll compare the test statistic to \\(t_{\\alpha,\\nu}\\), the value of the statistic at a given level of significance, identified using a table or calculator.\nThe test leads to two situations. The first, pictured below, is the situation where we fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that we have not seen evidence in the sample that the point estimate differs from what the modest hypothesis claims it is. Often, this is an estimate of a mean, where the population mean, \\(\\mu_0\\), is being estimated by a sample mean, \\(\\bar{y}\\). The following picture doesn’t show \\(\\bar{y}\\), just the tail. \\(\\bar{y}\\) would be at the top of the hump, not shown here.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above possibility shows the situation where \\(t_{\\alpha,\\nu}&gt;t_c\\), which is equivalent to saying that \\(p&gt;\\alpha\\).\nThe \\(x\\)-axis scale begins to the left of the fragment shown here, and values of \\(t\\) increase from left to right. At the same time, the shaded regions decrease in size from left to right. Note that the entire shaded region above is \\(p\\), while only the darker region at the right is \\(\\alpha\\).\nThe situation pictured below is the reverse. In this situation, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude instead that the point estimate does not equal the value in the modest hypothesis. In this case \\(t_{\\alpha,\\nu}&lt;t_c\\), which is equivalent to saying that \\(p&lt;\\alpha\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s make this more concrete with an example.\nSuppose that a bulk vending machine dispenses bags expected to contain 15 candies on average. The attendant who refills the machine claims it’s out of whack, dispensing more than 15 candies on average, requiring more frequent replenishment and costing the company some extra money. The company representative asks him for a sample from the machine, so he produces five bags containing 25, 23, 21, 21, and 20 candies. Develop a hypothesis test to consider the possibility that the vending machine is defective. Use a level of significance that makes sense given the situation described above.\nThere are seven steps to solving this problem, as follows.\nStep 1. Choose a null hypothesis.\nAt a high level, we can say that we are trying to choose between two alternatives:\n\nthat the machine is defective, or\nthat the machine is operating normally.\n\nWe need to reduce this high level view to numbers. The problem states that the machine is expected to dispense 15 candies per bag, on average. This is equivalent to saying that the true mean is 15 or \\(\\mu=15\\).\nIf the machine is defective in the way the attendant claims, then \\(\\mu&gt;15\\). So we could say that one of the hypotheses would be that the sample came from a population with \\(\\mu=15\\) and the other hypothesis would be that the sample did not come from a population with \\(\\mu=15\\). Which should be the null hypothesis?\nThe null hypothesis represents the status quo, what we would believe if we had no evidence either for or against. Do you believe that the machine is defective if there is no evidence either that it is or isn’t? Let’s put it another way. Suppose you arrested a person for a crime and then realized that you have no evidence that they did commit the crime and no evidence that they did not commit the crime. Would you imprison them or let them go free? If you let them go free, it means that your null hypothesis is that they are innocent unless proven guilty.\nThis suggests that if you have no evidence one way or the other, assume the machine is operating normally. We can translate this into the null hypothesis \\(\\mu=15\\). The formal way of writing the null hypothesis is to say \\(H_0: \\mu=\\mu_0\\), where \\(\\mu_0=15\\). Later, when refer to this population mean, we call it \\(\\mu_0\\) because it is the population mean associated with the hypothesis \\(H_0\\). So later we will say \\(\\mu_0=15\\).\nAt the end of step 1, we have chosen the null hypothesis: \\(H_0: \\mu=\\mu_0\\) with \\(\\mu_0=15\\).\nStep 2. Choose the alternative hypothesis. The appropriate alternative hypothesis can be selected from among three choices: \\(\\mu&lt;\\mu_0\\), \\(\\mu&gt;\\mu_0\\), or \\(\\mu \\ne \\mu_0\\). The appropriate choice here seems obvious: all the sample values are much larger than \\(\\mu_0\\), so if the mean we calculate differs from \\(\\mu_0\\) it will have to be larger than \\(\\mu_0\\). If all the values in our sample are larger than \\(\\mu_0\\), there is just no way their average can be smaller than \\(\\mu_0\\).\nAt the end of step 2, we have determined the alternative hypothesis to be\n\\(H_a: \\mu&gt;\\mu_0\\) with \\(\\mu_0=15\\).\nStep 3. Choose the test statistic. Previously, we have learned two test statistics, \\(z\\) and \\(t\\). We have learned that the choice between them is predicated on sample size. If \\(n\\geqslant30\\), use \\(z\\), otherwise use \\(t\\). Here \\(n=5\\) so use \\(t\\). We can calculate the \\(t\\)-statistic, which I called \\(t_c\\) for calculated above, for the sample using the formula \\[\nt=\\frac{\\overline{y}-\\mu_0}{s/\\sqrt{n}}\n\\]\nWe can calculate the values to use from the following formulas or by using a machine.\n\\[\\overline{y}=\\sum{y_i}/n=22\\]\n\\[s=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum y_i^2 -\nn(\\overline{y})^2}{n-1}}=2\\]\n\\(\\mu_0\\) was given to us in the problem statement and \\(\\sqrt{n}\\) can be determined with the use of a calculator or spreadsheet program. The calculated \\(t\\)-statistic is \\(t_c=(22-15)/(2/\\sqrt{5})=7.8262\\).\nAt the end of step 3, you have determined and calculated the test statistic, \\(t_c=7.8262\\).\nStep 4. Determine the level of significance, \\(\\alpha\\). You choose the appropriate value of \\(\\alpha\\) from the circumstances given in the problem statement. Previously in class, I claimed that there are three common levels of significance in use as sumarized in the table on page 35: 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10. I gave rules of thumb for these three as 0.01 life-or-death, 0.05 money is riding on it, and 0.10 casual / low budget. In this case, the consequences seem to be a small amount of money lost by the company if they are basically giving away candies for free. I suggest that this is a case where some money is riding on it so choose \\(\\alpha=0.05\\).\nAt the end of step 4, you have determined \\(\\alpha=0.05\\).\nStep 5. Identify the rejection region marker. This is simply a matter of calculating (or reading from a table) an appropriate \\(t\\)-statistic for the \\(\\alpha\\) you chose in the previous step. This is \\(t_{\\alpha,\\nu}=t_{0.05,4}=2.131847\\). Note that \\(\\nu\\) is the symbol the book uses for df, or degrees of freedom. It is a Greek letter pronounced nyoo. For a single sample \\(t\\)-statistic, df\\(=\\nu=n-1\\).\nThis can be found using R by saying\n\nqt(0.95,4)\n\n[1] 2.131847\n\n\nAt the end of step 5, you have calculated the location of the rejection region (but not its size). It is located everywhere between the \\(t\\) curve and the horizontal line to the right of the point \\(t=2.131847\\).\nStep 6. Calculate the \\(p\\)-value. This is the size of the region whose location was specified in the previous step, written as \\(p=P(t_{\\alpha,\\nu}&gt;t_c)\\). It is the probability of observing a \\(t\\)-statistic greater than the calculated \\(t\\)-statistic if the null hypothesis is true. It is found by a calculator or app or software. It can only be calculated by hand if you know quite a bit more math than is required for this course. In this case \\(p=P(t_{\\alpha,\\nu}&gt;t_c)=0.0007195\\).\nWe can identify both \\(t_\\alpha\\) and \\(t_c\\) using R as follows:\n\n#. t sub alpha\nqt(0.95,4)\n\n[1] 2.131847\n\n#. find the alpha region associated with t sub alpha\n1-pt(2.131847,4)\n\n[1] 0.04999999\n\nx &lt;- c(25,23,21,21,20)\nt.test(x,alternative=\"greater\",mu=15)\n\n\n    One Sample t-test\n\ndata:  x\nt = 7.8262, df = 4, p-value = 0.0007195\nalternative hypothesis: true mean is greater than 15\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 20.09322      Inf\nsample estimates:\nmean of x \n       22 \n\n\nAlso note that the \\(t\\) test tells us that the true mean is far from 15. If we tested repeatedly, we would find that it is greater than 20.09322 in 95 percent of the tests.\nAt the end of step 6, we have calculated the \\(p\\)-value, \\(p=P(t_{\\alpha,\\nu} &gt; t_c)=0.0007195\\).\nStep 7. Form a conclusion from the hypothesis test. We reject the null hypothesis that \\(\\mu=\\mu_0\\), or in other words, we reject the hypothesis that these five bags came from a vending machine that dispenses an average of 15 candies per bag. Notice we don’t that the machine is defective. Maybe the data were miscounted. We don’t know. We have to limit our conclusion to what we know about the data presented to us, which is that the data presented to us did not come from a machine that dispense an average of 15 candies per bag.\nTo summarize the answer, the seven elements of this statistical test of hypothesis are:\n\nnull hypothesis \\(H_0: \\mu=15\\)\nalternative hypothesis \\(H_{a}: \\mu&gt;15\\)\ntest statistic \\(t_c=7.8262\\)\nlevel of significance \\(\\alpha=0.05\\)\nrejection region marker \\(t_{0.05,4} = 2.131847\\)\n\\(p\\)-value \\(P(t_{\\alpha,\\nu}&gt;t_c)=0.0007195\\)\nconclusion Reject the null hypothesis that these five bags came from a machine that dispenses an average of 15 candies per bag.\n\nLet’s return to the two pictures we started with. Notice that \\(p&lt;\\alpha\\) in this case, which is equivalent to saying that \\(t_c&gt;t_{\\alpha,\\nu}\\), so we are looking at the second of the two pictures.\n\n\n\n\nMendenhall, William, and Terry Sincich. 2012.

    "text": "7.2 Textbook section 6.1 Inference for a single proportion\n\n7.2.1 Is the sample proportion nearly normal?\nNote: The book uses \\(p\\) in two ways: as a \\(p\\)-value in a hypothesis test, and as \\(p\\), a population proportion. Related to the population proportion is the sample proportion, \\(\\hat{p}\\), pronounced p-hat. Too many \\(p\\)s!\nThe sampling distribution for \\(\\hat{p}\\) based on a sample of size \\(n\\) from a population with a true proportion \\(p\\) is nearly normal when:\n\nThe sample’s observations are independent, e.g., are from a simple random sample.\nWe expected to see at least 10 successes and 10 failures in the sample, i.e., \\(np \\geqslant 10\\) and \\(n(1 − p) \\geqslant 10\\). This is called the success-failure condition.\n\nWhen these conditions are met, then the sampling distribution of \\(\\hat{p}\\) is nearly normal with mean \\(p\\) and standard error \\(\\text{SE}=\\sqrt{p(1-p)/n}\\).\n\n\n7.2.2 Confidence interval for a proportion\nA confidence interval provides a range of plausible values for the parameter \\(p\\), and when \\(\\hat{p}\\) can be modeled using a normal distribution, the confidence interval for \\(p\\) takes the form\n\\[ \\hat{p} \\pm z^{*} \\times \\text{SE} \\]\nwhere \\(z^{*}\\) marks the \\(x\\)-axis for the selected confidence interval, e.g., 1.96 for a 95 percent confidence interval.\n\n\n7.2.3 Prepare, Check, Calculate, Conclude Cycle\nThe OpenIntro Stats book recommends a four step cycle for both confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. It differs a bit from the seven step hypothesis testing method given in Week 06, but achieves the same result.\n\nPrepare. Identify \\(\\hat{p}\\) and \\(n\\), and determine what confidence level you wish to use.\nCheck. Verify the conditions to ensure \\(\\hat{p}\\) is nearly normal. For one-proportion confidence intervals, use \\(\\hat{p}\\) in place of \\(p\\) to check the success-failure condition.\nCalculate. If the conditions hold, compute SE using \\(\\hat{p}\\), find \\(z^{*}\\), and construct the interval.\nConclude. Interpret the confidence interval in the context of the problem.\n\n\n\n7.2.4 Same cycle for hypothesis testing for a proportion\n\nPrepare. Identify the parameter of interest, list hypotheses, identify the significance level, and identify \\(\\hat{p}\\) and \\(n\\).\nCheck. Verify conditions to ensure \\(\\hat{p}\\) is nearly normal under \\(H_0\\). For one-proportion hypothesis tests, use the null value to check the success-failure condition.\nCalculate. If the conditions hold, compute the standard error, again using \\(p_0\\), compute the \\(Z\\)-score, and identify the \\(p\\)-value.\nConclude. Evaluate the hypothesis test by comparing the \\(p\\)-value to \\(\\alpha\\), and provide a conclusion in the context of the problem.\n\n\n\n7.2.5 Choosing sample size when estimating a proportion\nThis is probably the most important part of this section for practical purposes. The following expression denotes the margin of error:\n\\[ z^{*}\\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} \\]\nYou have to choose the margin of error you want to report. The book gives an example of 0.04. So you want to find\n\\[ z^{*}\\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} &lt; 0.04 \\]\nThe problem is that you don’t know \\(p\\). Since the worst-case scenario is \\(p=0.5\\), you have to use that unless you have some information about \\(p\\). Recall that \\(z^{*}\\) represents the \\(z\\)-score for the desired confidence level, so you have to choose that. The book gives an example where you want a 95 percent confidence level, so you choose 1.96. You could find this out in R by saying\n\nqnorm(0.025,lower.tail=FALSE)\n\n[1] 1.959964\n\n\nreturning the \\(z\\)-score for the upper tail. The reason for saying that 0.025 instead of 0.05 is that the probability of 0.05 is split between the tails. The complementary function is pnorm(1.959964,lower.tail=FALSE), which will return 0.025.\nOnce you have decided on values for \\(p\\) and \\(z^*\\), solve the above inequality for \\(n\\)."

    "text": "7.4 Textbook section 6.3 Testing goodness of fit using \\(\\chi^2\\)\nThe \\(\\chi^2\\) test, pronounced k\\(\\overline{\\text{i}}\\) square, is useful in many circumstances. The textbook treats two such circumstances:\n\nSuppose your sample can be divided into groups, as can the general population. Does your sample represent the general population?\nDoes your sample resemble a particular distribution, such as the normal distribution?\n\nFor the first circumstance, we could divide a sample of people into races or genders and we would like to examine all at once for resemblance to the general population, rather than in pairs. The \\(\\chi^2\\) statistic will permit an all-at-once comparison.\nThe \\(\\chi^2\\) statistic is given by the following formula for \\(g\\) groups.\n\\[ \\chi^2 = \\frac{(\\text{observed count}_1-\\text{null count}_1)^2}{\\text{null count}_1} + \\cdots + \\frac{(\\text{observed count}_g-\\text{null count}_g)^2}{\\text{null count}_g} \\]\nwhere the expression null count refers to the expected number of objects in the group. You have to be careful about how you determine the null count. For instance, the textbook gives an example of races of jurors. In such a case, the null counts should come from the population who can be selected as jurors. This might be a matter of some dispute since jurors are usually recruited through voting records and these records may not reflect the correct proportions. Statisticians tend to like things they can count, and some people are harder (more expensive) to count than others, particularly people in marginalized populations.\n\n7.4.1 The \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution\nThe \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution is sometimes used to characterize data sets and statistics that are always positive and typically right skewed. Recall a normal distribution had two parameters – mean and standard deviation – that could be used to describe its exact characteristics. The \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution has just one parameter called degrees of freedom (df), which influences the shape, center, and spread of the distribution. Here is a picture of the \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution for several values of df.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the jurors example, we can calculate the appropriate \\(p\\)-value in R by using the \\(\\chi^2\\) statistic calculated from the sample, 5.89, and the parameter \\(k-1\\) which is the number of groups minus one, using R:\n\npchisq(5.89,3,lower.tail=FALSE)\n\n[1] 0.1170863\n\n\nThis is a relatively large \\(p\\)-value given our earlier choices of cutoffs of 0.1, 0.05, and 0.01.\n\n\n7.4.2 \\(\\chi^2\\) test\nThe \\(\\chi^2\\) test can be conducted in R for the juror example given in the book as follows.\n\no &lt;- c(205,26,25,19)\ne &lt;- c(198,19.25,33,24.75)/sum(o)\nchisq.test(o,p=e)\n\n\n    Chi-squared test for given probabilities\n\ndata:  o\nX-squared = 5.8896, df = 3, p-value = 0.1171\n\n\nNote that I had to make an adjustment in R. The R variable p is supposed to be a vector of probabilities summing to 1. The way the table in the book presented it, it was not a vector of probabilities summing to one. So I divided each element of the input vector for e by the sum of the vector o."

That way, I can view the structure of your document. Note that there are already level 1 and level 2 headings built in. You can add more.\nThe visual description section should not have long lists of numbers but rather graphics.\nAny list of numbers more than two screensful is unreadable by a manager anyway.\nGroup members need to spend more time and effort coordinating with each other.\nExplanations of your graphics help me believe that you understand what you are doing.\nThe numerical description is supposed to be left in and improved where possible. You are trying to build the components of a single coherent report, being added to with each milestone.\nIt is unwise to sign your individual names to the individual sections. This is supposed to be a group effort. You should be helping each other and reviewing the total package when it’s assembled.\nThere are techniques you can use to stay out of each other’s way. For example, how could you avoid giving two data frames the same name? (Hint: include your initials in the names of data frames you generate.)\nThe first two milestones are about description. It is not always reliable to make inferences from the descriptions. The second two milestones are about inferences. For example, it makes no sense to say that paint colors are evenly distributed among warm and cold states without doing a hypothesis test. A simple bar chart can provide a hint as to which hypothesis test you can run, but can’t substitute for a hypothesis test.\nIt is well known that it is hard to spot the differences between two versions of a file. That is why there is a whole industry of diff programs to highlight differences between files. You should each obtain and use some sort of diff program. For example, I use vimdiff because I use the Vim text editor. For relatively sophisticated text editors, there is likely to be a matching diff program or module. When you send me a file and I make changes to it, you should compare it to your original file using some version of diff. All information professionals should know about diff. For example, it is at the root of github, a website used by many information professionals.\nIf you only do what you’re explicitly told to do, you can and will be replaced by a bot. You have to be adventurous to be a valuable information professional."

    "text": "8.2 Individual Work 1 Review\n\n8.2.1 Product and Process\nThere’s a difference between the product you produce and the process you go through to get there. Sometimes you need to include aspects of the process and sometimes you don’t.\nAs an example of both, I investigated the bikes data. Through googling, I discovered that it actually came from Washington, DC. Since it began on January 1, 2011 and the day of the week was listed as 6, I opened a terminal on my Mac and said cal jan 2011, returning a calendar showing that January 1st was a Saturday. That way, I knew how to encode the days of the week as shown below, with Sunday as zero.\nNext, I noticed that January 1st had a 1 in the holiday column, so I inferred that 1 means yes and 0 means no. So I coded the labels that way. The same was true of workingday.\nThe column weathersit was an interesting problem. Examining the lengthy description of that column, I decided to code it as an ordered factor, with one being the best weather and 4 being the worst.\nFinally, I noticed that temp was coded in a way that made it hard for a Fahrenheit user like me to relate to. So I followed the formula in the description to convert the temperature to Fahrenheit. I did that in several lines so I could check my work and I left it in the code, so I could come back to it easily if I later discovered a problem with it.\nFollowing is my creation of the types. Notice that I also saved a copy of the typed data in bikes.RData so I could quit R and quickly restart in case things got messed up.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\ndf &lt;- read_csv(paste0(Sys.getenv(\"STATS_DATA_DIR\"),\"/bikes.csv\"))\ndf$instant &lt;- as.integer(df$instant)\ndf$season &lt;- factor(df$season,levels=1:4,labels=c(\"winter\",\"spring\",\"summer\",\"fall\"))\ndf$yr &lt;- factor(df$yr,levels=0:1,labels=c(\"first\",\"second\"),ordered=TRUE)\ndf$mnth &lt;- factor(df$mnth,levels=1:12,labels=c(\"Jan\",\"Feb\",\"Mar\",\"Apr\",\"May\",\"Jun\",\"Jul\",\"Aug\",\"Sep\",\"Oct\",\"Nov\",\"Dec\"),ordered=TRUE)\ndf$hr &lt;- factor(df$hr,levels=0:23,ordered=TRUE)\ndf$holiday &lt;- factor(df$holiday,levels=0:1,labels=c(\"no\",\"yes\"))\ndf$weekday &lt;- factor(df$weekday,levels=0:6,labels=c(\"Sunday\",\"Monday\",\"Tuesday\",\"Wednesday\",\"Thursday\",\"Friday\",\"Saturday\"),ordered=TRUE)\ndf$workingday &lt;- factor(df$workingday,levels=0:1,labels=c(\"no\",\"yes\"))\ndf$weathersit &lt;- factor(df$weathersit,levels=1:4,labels=c(\"best\",\"good\",\"poor\",\"worst\"))\ndf$casual &lt;- as.integer(df$casual)\ndf$registered &lt;- as.integer(df$registered)\ndf$cnt &lt;- as.integer(df$cnt)\nt_min &lt;- -8\nt_max &lt;- 39\n#. df$temp == (t-t_min)/(t_max-t_min)\n#.

I started by saying things like summary(df$temp) but I noticed that it was pretty hard to read for a manager and the assignment spec calls for a report you can give to a manager. (Later, you’ll learn how to make the reports even more manager-friendly.)\nSo I googled an expression like r summary statistics for all columns and immediately came across vtable, a package to do just that. So I read its documentation, which mentioned that there are many similar packages. Instead of searching for those packages and comparing them, I just tried the st() function in vtable, with the following result.\n\nlibrary(vtable)\nst(df)\n\n\nSummary Statistics\n\n\nVariable\nN\nMean\nStd.

Then I tried the st() function again, found more errors, and so on until I was completely satisfied that I had fixed everything.\nNext, I made a couple of contingency tables. These made me think about the meaning of the rows in the data and the fact that not all hours are covered. I went back to the output of st() above and learned more before I made the following description for the contingency tables.\nThe next two tables show the numbers of hours when riders experienced each weather condition, first during each season, then on each weekday.\n\naddmargins(table(df$season,df$weathersit))\n\n        \n          best  good  poor worst   Sum\n  winter  2665  1205   369     3  4242\n  spring  2859  1144   406     0  4409\n  summer  3280   947   269     0  4496\n  fall    2609  1248   375     0  4232\n  Sum    11413  4544  1419     3 17379\n\naddmargins(table(df$weekday,df$weathersit))\n\n           \n             best  good  poor worst   Sum\n  Sunday     1765   568   169     0  2502\n  Monday     1582   726   170     1  2479\n  Tuesday    1522   694   237     0  2453\n  Wednesday  1568   613   293     1  2475\n  Thursday   1656   636   179     0  2471\n  Friday     1645   659   183     0  2487\n  Saturday   1675   648   188     1  2512\n  Sum       11413  4544  1419     3 17379\n\n\nAfter a few more boring contingency tables, I switched to visualizations. First, I just started aimlessly dong visualizations and looking at them. Let me emphasize that I wouldn’t necessarily include these in my final report. They are just exploratory at this point to see if I find something interesting.\n\ndf |&gt; ggplot(aes(mnth,fahr)) + geom_line()\n\n\n\ndf |&gt; ggplot(aes(mnth,cnt)) + geom_line()\n\n\n\ndf |&gt; ggplot(aes(weathersit,cnt)) + geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\ndf |&gt; ggplot(aes(season,cnt)) + geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\ndf |&gt; ggplot(aes(weekday,cnt)) + geom_violin()\n\n\n\ndf |&gt; ggplot(aes(hr,cnt)) + geom_violin()\n\n\n\ndf |&gt; ggplot(aes(casual)) + geom_histogram()\n\n\n\ndf |&gt; ggplot(aes(registered)) + geom_histogram()\n\n\n\n\nBingo! I have found something interesting in the last two plots above. But the way they’re done doesn’t reveal enough. When drawing histograms of the casual riders and the registered riders, it really stands out that there’s a hump in the registered riders, while there’s exponential decay in the casual riders. You can illustrate this by combining the two, casual and registered, into a single density plot as follows.\n\ncas &lt;- data.frame(vol=df$casual)\nreg &lt;- data.frame(vol=df$registered)\ncas$type &lt;- \"casual\"\nreg$type &lt;- \"registered\"\ncombined &lt;- rbind(cas,reg)\nggplot(combined,aes(vol,fill=type)) + geom_density(alpha=0.3)\n\n\n\n\nHow did I come up with this? The main thing was a process of exploring the data through visualizing, making a discovery, then communicating that discovery. I would remove the two histograms (and most of the plots above them, too) and instead substitute the density plot in a report, never really showing the manager the process I went through.\nIncidentally, I simple googled tidyverse difference between two histograms to come up with the code for the density plot, which I adapted from one of many good answers on stackoverflow.\n\n\n8.2.2 Common Mistakes\nIt’s tough to grade this exercise because there’s a tension between two factors. First is the amount of work you put in, which, in most cases, was a lot. I want to reward you for that.\nSecond is that you made a lot of common sense mistakes. There’s a big difference between making mistakes in coding, which is only natural in a new language, and making mistakes that a manager unfamiliar with code will notice.\nLet me list a few such mistakes here.\n\nIncredibly long contingency tables: Think about what a manager can possibly learn from the artifacts you produce—if a table goes on for many screensful of output, it doesn’t do any more than presenting the raw data\nGraphics that are hard to read and look almost identical to each other: Think about what a manager can infer from a bunch of nearly identical graphics\nExplanations that don’t make any sense considering the data, such as assuming that the left side of a graphic that doesn’t include time refers to early data\nExplanations that are overly obvious, such as the fact that the data begins in winter and continues into summer"

    "text": "8.4 Inference for numerical data\n\nTextbook section 7.1 One-sample means with the t-distribution\nTextbook section 7.2 Paired data\nTextbook section 7.3 Difference of two means\nTextbook section 7.4 Power calculations for a difference of means\nTextbook section 7.5 Comparing many means with ANOVA\n\n\n8.4.1 Textbook Section 7.1 One-sample means with the \\(t\\)-distribution\nModeling \\(\\bar{x}\\), the mean of a random sample from a normally distributed population, requires that the sample elements are\n\nindependent—a random sample or a sample from a random process\nnormally distributed—sample drawn from a normally distributed population\n\n\n8.4.1.1 Rule of thumb for normality\n\n\\(n &lt; 30\\) and no outliers, assume data come from a normally distributed population\n\\(n \\geqslant 30\\) and no extreme outliers, assume \\(\\bar{x}\\sim N(\\mu,\\sigma)\\) even if data come from a not normally distributed population\n\n\n\n8.4.1.2 \\(t\\)-distribution\nThe \\(t\\)-distribution is useful for small samples (\\(n&lt;30\\)). It was discovered when a man named Gossett was trying to figure out how few samples of beer he could get away with in tests for the Guinness brewery about 120 years ago. He preferred to remain anonymous at the time because he didn’t want his employers to question his outside activities, otherwise this would probably be called the Gossett’s \\(t\\)-distribution. Instead, he referred to himself as “A Student” so it came to be known as the Student’s \\(t\\)-distribution.\nFor sample sizes over thirty, it converges to looking like the normal distribution, but for smaller samples, it gets more and more peaked and the tails get thicker and thicker. For example, here is the density function for a sample size of 4.\n\nplot(function(x) dt(x, df = 3), -11, 11, ylim = c(0, 0.50), main = \"t density function\", yaxs = \"i\")\n\n\n\n\nBear in mind that the t() function in R has nothing to do with the \\(t\\)-distribution (it’s for transposing matrices and data frames). Instead, the functions for handling the \\(t\\)-distribution are the letter t prefaced by d, q, p, or r. You may have noticed that we saw functions like pnorm() and dnorm() when working with the normal distribution. These functions are analogous.\nThe \\(t\\)-distribution has \\(n-1\\) degrees of freedom, so you can tell that the above example has \\(n=4\\) since \\(\\text{df}=3\\).\nAlso keep in mind that the mean is always zero for the \\(t\\)-distribution, so it just has one parameter, df. So in the above example, you could say \\(\\bar{x}\\sim t(3)\\).\nAnalogous to the pnorm() function, you can calculate regions of the \\(t\\)-distribution using the pt() function. For example, if you conduct a test that returns a \\(t\\)-statistic of \\(-2.10\\) and \\(n=19\\), you can use the following to find out that the area to the left of the statistic is 0.025. (This example and the two following are illustrated in textbook Figure 7.4.)\n\npt(-2.1,18)\n\n[1] 0.0250452\n\n\nSuppose you obtain a \\(t\\)-statistic of 1.65 on 20 degrees of freedom. How much of the probability is in the upper tail? There are two obvious ways to do this.\n\npt(1.65,20,lower.tail=FALSE)\n\n[1] 0.05728041\n\n1-pt(1.65,20)\n\n[1] 0.05728041\n\n\nFind the probability in both tails for a \\(t\\)-statistic of \\(\\pm 3\\) and two degrees of freedom.\n\npt(-3,2)+pt(3,2,lower.tail=FALSE)\n\n[1] 0.09546597\n\n\nTextbook example 7.8 asks you to calculate the \\(t\\)-statistic when you know the proportion. In this case, \\(df=18\\) and you want to know the \\(t\\)-statistic corresponding to 0.025 in the upper tail. You can use the qt() function where q stands for quantile. The region 0.025 in the upper tail corresponds to a 95 percent confidence interval because there will be 0.025 in each of the two tails for a total of five percent. The \\(t\\)-statistic for the lower tail would simply be the negative of the \\(t\\)-statistic for the upper tail.\n\nqt(0.025,18,lower.tail=FALSE)\n\n[1] 2.100922\n\n\nTo construct a confidence interval, you’ll generally choose 90 or 95 percent, depending on the sensitivity of the real world problem. Then you’ll plug that into the following formula.\n\\[\n\\bar{x} \\pm t^*_{df}\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\n\\]\nThis assumes you have already checked the normality and independence constraints.\n\n\n8.4.1.3 Calculating a confidence interval\nFor the textbook examples, you are given components of the formula. It is quite a bit simpler if you are given the raw data. For example, calculate a 95 percent confidence interval for the body mass in grams of the penguins in the Palmer penguins data frame.\n\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\nmodel &lt;- lm(body_mass_g ~ 1,penguins)\nconfint(model,level=0.95)\n\n               2.5 %  97.5 %\n(Intercept) 4116.458 4287.05\n\n\nThe above incantation may seem a little mysterious but you’ll explore it in excruciating detail when you learn linear regression.\n\n\n8.4.1.4 One sample \\(t\\)-tests\nThe textbook gives a lengthy example of the runner times of the Cherry Blossom race. I assume that the data are the run10samp and run17samp data frames from the textbook website, so I downloaded the RData versions of them and loaded them as follows.\n\nload(paste0(Sys.getenv(\"STATS_DATA_DIR\"),\"/run10samp.rda\"))\nload(paste0(Sys.getenv(\"STATS_DATA_DIR\"),\"/run17samp.rda\"))\nt.test(run17samp$clock_sec/60,mu=93.29,alternative=\"t\")\n\n\n    One Sample t-test\n\ndata:  run17samp$clock_sec/60\nt = 1.9776, df = 99, p-value = 0.05075\nalternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 93.29\n95 percent confidence interval:\n  93.26973 105.46227\nsample estimates:\nmean of x \n   99.366 \n\n\nNote that neither time measure, clock_sec nor net_sec correspond to the mean in the textbook. The \\(t\\)-statistic is smaller and the \\(p\\)-value is larger than that given in the textbook. With a \\(p\\)-value of 0.05075 it is unclear whether you would reject the null hypothesis. Certainly the old mean is within, though at the edge, of the confidence interval. Personally, I would fail to reject in this case.\n\n\n\n8.4.2 Textbook Section 7.2 Paired data\nSuppose you want to know if two data frames were drawn from the same distribution or if they differ.\nThe textbook example is of the mean prices of textbooks on Amazon and in the UCLA campus bookstore. The data appear to be the textbooks data frame on the textbook website, although the statistics are different and the textbook says that there were two such samples (only one is on the website that I could find). Because they have precomputed the difference as the diff column, you can do this the same way as for a one sample test.\n\nload(paste0(Sys.getenv(\"STATS_DATA_DIR\"),\"/textbooks.rda\"))\nwith(textbooks,t.test(diff))\n\n\n    One Sample t-test\n\ndata:  diff\nt = 7.6488, df = 72, p-value = 6.928e-11\nalternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n  9.435636 16.087652\nsample estimates:\nmean of x \n 12.76164 \n\n\nNote that the default is that the difference is 0 and the 95 percent confidence interval is quite far from including 0. Also, the \\(p\\)-value is infinitesimal. We definitely reject the null hypothesis that the stores have similar prices.\nIf you didn’t have the diff column, you could get the same result by saying the following.\n\nwith(textbooks,t.test(ucla_new,amaz_new,paired=TRUE))\n\n\n    Paired t-test\n\ndata:  ucla_new and amaz_new\nt = 7.6488, df = 72, p-value = 6.928e-11\nalternative hypothesis: true mean difference is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n  9.435636 16.087652\nsample estimates:\nmean difference \n       12.76164 \n\n\n\n\n8.4.3 Textbook Section 7.3 Difference of two means\nIn the previous section, you considered the means of the differences but in this section you consider the differences of the means. In the Amazon and UCLA example, the items were paired and we subtracted the price of a particular title sold by one seller from the price of the same title sold by the other seller. But what if we have data that is not paired like this? The textbook gives an example of a radical stem cell treatment given to sheep. One of two treatments is given to each sheep, but there is no correspondence between individual pairs of sheep.\nIn this case, there may be different variance between the two groups, as well as different means. So the standard error is calculated as\n\\[\\text{SE}=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma^2_1}{n_1}+\\frac{\\sigma^2_2}{n_2}}\\]\nNotice that this formula implies that the samples could differ in size as well as variance.\nFor the sheep example, heart pumping capacity was measured, where more is better. The stem_cell data frame on the textbook website seems to be the appropriate data frame here. Conducting the test in R follows.\n\nload(paste0(Sys.getenv(\"STATS_DATA_DIR\"),\"/stem_cell.rda\"))\nwith(stem_cell,t.test(after-before~trmt,var.equal=FALSE))\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  after - before by trmt\nt = -4.0073, df = 12.225, p-value = 0.001678\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group ctrl and group esc is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -12.083750  -3.582916\nsample estimates:\nmean in group ctrl  mean in group esc \n         -4.333333           3.500000 \n\n\nThe result is a statistically significant difference between the sheep in the control group and the sheep treated with stem cells. The sheep in the stem cell group enjoyed a 3.5 unit increase in heart pumping capacity, while the poor sheep in the control group lost four and a third units. Of course, the practical question you have to ask yourself is whether these numbers have a practical significance. You would need domain knowledge to tell whether 3.5 units is a lot of heart pumping capacity!\n\n\n8.4.4 Textbook Section 7.4 Power calculations for a difference of means\nThe pictures in section 7.4, particularly the two on page 280 of the textbook, are essential for understanding power calculation, so let’s use the textbook exclusively for this section. To do the calculations in R, you can use the pwr package.\n\n\n8.4.5 Textbook Section 7.5 Comparing many means with ANOVA\nTextbook exercise 7.54 compares eight methods for loosening rusty bolts. Four samples were collected for each method and the results are in the penetrating_oil data frame on the textbook website. You can conduct an ANOVA test on the results using R as follows.\n\nload(paste0(Sys.getenv(\"STATS_DATA_DIR\"),\"/penetrating_oil.rda\"))\nwith(penetrating_oil,anova(lm(torque~treatment)))\n\nAnalysis of Variance Table\n\nResponse: torque\n          Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value   Pr(&gt;F)   \ntreatment  7 3603.4  514.78  4.0263 0.005569 **\nResiduals 22 2812.8  127.85                    \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nHere you are comparing whether any of the eight means of torque differ. They certainly seem to, with a large \\(F\\)-statistic and a small \\(p\\)-value. It might be helpful to visualize the differences with a combination violin plot and boxplot. There are really too few samples for each treatment.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\npenetrating_oil |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(torque,treatment)) +\n  geom_violin() +\n  geom_boxplot(width=0.1)"

    "section": "9.2 Linear Regression",
    "text": "9.2 Linear Regression\n\n9.2.1 Introduction\nLet’s start with an example. Suppose we know how many times a team has won and we can graph it as follows. I haven’t included a scale on the graph but the underlying numbers of wins are 9, 15, 18, 22.5 (a tie), and 23.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is our best prediction of the number of wins for a new team, irrespective of any other information. The answer is the mean of this number of wins, 17.5. It’s not a very good prediction but it’s the best we can do, given what little we know. Now suppose we know how much the team spends on player salaries. We’ll call that variable payroll and add it to the graph.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we can see a pattern. Teams that spend more win more! But that’s not strictly true because there must be other variables at play. Right now, we don’t know what those variables are. But the best prediction we can make for the number of wins for a given new team depends in part on its payroll. We can now draw a diagonal line through this cloud of points and say that that line represents the best prediction for number of wins, like so.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne immediate question to ask is whether the diagonal line pictured above is the best line. People searched for ways of finding the best line for a long time before the most popular method, least squares, was published in 1805. That is the method used most frequently by software but other methods have emerged since then.\nThe best line is often called the least squares line and it is characterized by two numbers, the slope and the intercept. The intercept is the height at which it intersects the y axis and the slope is the ratio of its rise (its increaase or decrease on the y axis) over its run (its increase or decrease on the x axis). Both the slope and intercept can be positive or negative. A slope of zero or infinity is meaningless. In the statistics world, the intercept is usually called \\(\\beta_0\\), pronounced beta nought, and the slope is usually called \\(\\beta_1\\), pronounced beta one. The reason we use the numeral one is because additional slopes will be considered when we talk about multiple regression.\nThe Diez, Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Barr (2019) textbook differs a bit from standard practice, using the Latin letter b in place of the Greek \\(\\beta\\). This works well from my point of view because Latin letters are often used to denote estimates of parameters, while the parameters themselves are denoted by Greek letters. Keep in mind that we’re always working with samples so we’re estimating the true slope and intercept with \\(b_1\\) and \\(b_0\\). Other statistics books sometimes use \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) to refer to estimates, which is kind of cumbersome.\nMost of our discussion of regression will focus on this least squares line and how good it is. Keep in mind that the word regression is more general than least squares. There are other methods and applications. Least squares is just the easiest way to introduce regression.\nWhat does the term least squares mean? In the following picture, we have added vertical lines connecting the dots to the least squares line. The squares of the lengths of these lines are the way we measure the quality of the line.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the following pictures, the prediction line on the right is better than that on the left by an amount proportional to the difference between the total length of pink lines in the two pictures. Notice that both lines represent the very best possible prediction for that set of dots. It’s just that, on the right hand side, there’s a closer correspondence between payroll and wins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.2.2 Correlation\nCorrelation is a concept that measures the strength of the linear relationship between two variables. We usually use Pearson’s correlation coefficient, \\(r\\), to measure this kind of relationship. Note that our textbook uses \\(R\\) instead of \\(r\\) to denote this relationship. This is unfortunate, because almost every other statistics book makes a distinction between \\(R\\) as the multiple correlation coefficient and \\(r\\) as Pearson’s correlation coefficient. They happen to be identical in the case of one \\(x\\) and one \\(y\\), but soon we will consider the case of more than one \\(x\\), where they differ.\n\\[r=\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum^n_{i=1}\\frac{x_i-\\bar{x}}{s_x}\\frac{y_i-\\bar{y}}{s_y}\\]\n\n\n9.2.3 Least squares line\nDiez, Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Barr (2019) gives the following formulas for finding the least squares line.\n\nFind the slope.\n\n\\[b_1=\\frac{s_y}{s_x}r\\]\n\nFind the intercept.\n\n\\[b_0=\\bar{y}-b_1\\bar{x}\\]\nTypically, you use software to identify these numbers. For example, consider the payroll / wins example from above, calculated in R.\n\ny&lt;-c(9,18,15,23,22.5)\nx&lt;-c(5,10,15,20,25)\nsummary(lm(y~x))\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = y ~ x)\n\nResiduals:\n   1    2    3    4    5 \n-2.1  3.7 -2.5  2.3 -1.4 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

Then I constructed a linear model of \\(y\\) explained by \\(x\\). The lm() function constructs a linear model and the tilde character (\\(\\sim\\)) separates the response variable \\(y\\) from the explanatory variable \\(x\\). The summary() function is wrapped around the lm() function to provide the most commonly accessed values of the output of the lm() function.\nThe first value output by summary() is the call. This simply shows the formula entered, which in this case was \\(y\\sim x\\).\nThe next value output by summary() is a list of residuals. These are the differences between the predicted values and the actual values of wins.\nThe third value output by summary() is the coefficients table. The \\(b\\) values are listed in the Estimate column. Instead of being named \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\) they are called (Intercept) and x. The remainder of this table consists of statistics about them. The second column is standard error, the third column is the \\(t\\)-statistic, which is the ratio of the estimate to its standard error. The third column is the \\(p\\)-value, which is the probability of seeing the preceding \\(t\\)-statistic or a larger one if the null hypothesis is true. The null hypothesis here is that \\(x\\) does not predict \\(y\\).\nThe last column in the coefficents table contains the significance codes. In this case, \\(x\\) gets a significance code of dot (.). Below the coefficients table is a legend for the significance codes. That tells us that dot means that the \\(p\\)-value for \\(x\\) is below 0.1. The blank in the other row tells us that the significance code for the intercept is less than 1, which it must be because probabilities can be no larger than 1.\nBelow the coefficients table we see four important values expressed - Multiple R-squared, which is identical to \\(r^2\\) above, - Adjusted R-squared, which we will discuss when we discuss multiple linear regression, - the F-statistic, which we will also discuss under multiple linear regression, and - the \\(p\\)-value of the F-statistic.\nThese latter values are all more interesting in the case of multiple linear regression. For simple linear regression we have enough information in the body of the coefficients table to make a judgment about whether the linear model \\(y\\sim x\\) is sufficient to explain a team’s wins. That judgment depends on whether we are being casual, in which case the model is sufficient, or whether we have money riding on it, in which case the model is just barely insufficient.\n\n\n9.2.4 Assumptions\nBear in mind that we make four big assumptions in using this model at all. The assumptions are mentioned in the book as follows.\n\nLinearity: the data show a linear trend, identified by a scatterplot for instance\nNormally distributed residuals: identified by a Q-Q plot, to be described later\nConstant variability: \\(x\\) does not vary more or less depending on \\(y\\)\nIndependent observations: there is not a pattern like seasonality or growth or decline in the underlying phenomenon being analyzed (special statistics tools are used for that)\n\nMost textbooks use more technical terms for these concepts, especially homoscedasticity for constant variability and heteroscedasticity for non-constant variability. This book just doesn’t want to introduce too much terminology.\nThe most common assumptions violated in my experience are the first and third. There is often a curvilinear pattern in data that is not captured by a linear model. Also, graphs of data often exhibit a pattern like the cross-section of a horn, which is non-constant variability or heteroscedasticity.\n\n\n9.2.5 The Multiple Coefficient of Determination\n\\(R^2\\) is the most common measure of the strength of a linear relationship, partly because it varies between 0 and 1. It is the proportion of variability in the data explained by the model. It is very domain dependent. For a lot of cases, anything below 0.8 indicates a poor fit. On the other hand, there are areas of physics where 0.1 explains enough of the data to be valuable. You have to consider the domain when evaluating \\(R^2\\).\n\n\n9.2.6 Categorical Variables\nWith linear regression, the \\(y\\) variable must NEVER be categorical. If you try to do regression in R with the \\(y\\) variable as categorical, you’ll get an error message. There is another procedure you can do, called logistic regression, which has a categorical \\(y\\). We’ll discuss that later. But for now, bear in mind when you form a model, the outcome is always a continuously valued variable.\nOn the other hand, any or all of the input variables may be categorical. Note the book’s example of Mario Kart sales. The categorical variable condition has two levels or categories, whether the game is new or used. The outcome variable is the price, which is of course a continuous variable. When you input a categorical variable in R, it automatically encodes it as a number. In the Mario Kart case, the numbers are zero and one. The condition new is shown in the same place on the R output as \\(b_1\\) and the condition used is shown as the intercept. The main idea to understand here is the difference between the two, where the used condition is zero and the new condition is the difference between the price of new and used.\n\n\n9.2.7 Outliers\nBack in the nineteen seventies, several prominent statisticians said that statistics needed visualization. Their influece is actually responsible for my teaching visualization in this course. One of them, Francis Anscombe, published a data frame that showed how misleading elementary statistics can be without visualization. This data frame has come to be called Anscombe’s quartet and it is often shown to students. Here it is.\n\n\n\n\nx1\nx2\nx3\nx4\ny1\ny2\ny3\ny4\n\n\n\n\n10\n10\n10\n8\n8.04\n9.14\n7.46\n6.58\n\n\n8\n8\n8\n8\n6.95\n8.14\n6.77\n5.76\n\n\n13\n13\n13\n8\n7.58\n8.74\n12.74\n7.71\n\n\n9\n9\n9\n8\n8.81\n8.77\n7.11\n8.84\n\n\n11\n11\n11\n8\n8.33\n9.26\n7.81\n8.47\n\n\n14\n14\n14\n8\n9.96\n8.10\n8.84\n7.04\n\n\n6\n6\n6\n8\n7.24\n6.13\n6.08\n5.25\n\n\n4\n4\n4\n19\n4.26\n3.10\n5.39\n12.50\n\n\n12\n12\n12\n8\n10.84\n9.13\n8.15\n5.56\n\n\n7\n7\n7\n8\n4.82\n7.26\n6.42\n7.91\n\n\n\n\nEach \\(x,y\\) pair of this quartet has the same basic statistics and the exact same least squares line.

    "text": "9.4 Multiple regression intro (Chapter 9)\nEverything we’ve done so far has assumed that we know one piece of information’s relationship to another piece of information. Take the example of teams, where we knew the payroll and want to know the number of wins. Suppose we also knew a number of other statistics that might affect wins. How would we incorporate them? The answer is simple. We add them. Because we’re using a linear equation, that is, the equation of a line to model the data, there’s no reason we can’t add terms to the equation. These terms are additive, meaning that we add each term and each term has a coefficient. So now, our estimate of \\(y\\), which we call \\(\\hat{y}\\), looks like this for \\(n\\) terms.\n\\[\\hat{y}=b_0+b_1x_1+b_2x_2+\\cdots+b_nx_n\\]\nIn R, we simply add the column names. For example, consider the built-in data frame mtcars where the outcome variable is mpg. We can construct a model of the relationship between mpg and two input variables we suspect of influencing mpg as follows.\n\nwith(mtcars,summary(lm(mpg ~ hp+wt)))\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = mpg ~ hp + wt)\n\nResiduals:\n   Min     1Q Median     3Q    Max \n-3.941 -1.600 -0.182  1.050  5.854 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

First, there are 32 residuals, so the individual residuals are not listed. Instead, you see summary statistics for the residuals.\nNext, look at the coefficients table. There are three rows now, for the intercept, for hp, and for wt. Notice that all three have significance codes at the end of the row. Normally, you shouldn’t be concerned about the significance code for the intercept, but the other two are interesting. The code for hp is two stars, meaning that it is less than 0.01, while the code for wt is 1.12e-06, which is abbreviated scientific notation, meaning to take 1.12 and shift the decimal point six places to the left, giving 0.00000112 as the decimal equivalent.\nThe Multiple R-squared is 82 percent and the Adjusted R-squared is 81 percent. This is a good sign because the Adjusted R-squared is adjusted for the case where you have included too many variables on the right hand side of the linear model formula. If it’s similar to Multiple R-squared, that means you probably have not included too many variables.\nThe \\(F\\)-statistic is important now, because of its interpretation. The \\(F\\)-statistic tells you that at least one of the variables is significant, taken in combination with the others. The \\(t\\)-statistics only give the individual contribution of the variables, so it’s possible to have a significant \\(t\\)-statistic without a significant \\(F\\)-statistic. The first thing to check in regression output is the \\(F\\)-statistic. If it’s too small, i.e., has a large \\(p\\)-value, try a different model.\nYou might think that including more variables results in a strictly better model. This is not true for reasons to be explored later. For now, try including all the variables in the data frame by the shorthand of a dot on the right hand side of the formula.\n\nsummary(lm(mpg ~ ., data=mtcars))\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = mpg ~ ., data = mtcars)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-3.4506 -1.6044 -0.1196  1.2193  4.6271 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

You know from the \\(F\\)-statistic that at least one of the variables is contributing significantly to the model but individually, the contributions seem minimal based on the small \\(t\\)-statistics. The model is only a bit better, explaining 86 percent of the variability in the data, and the adjusted \\(R^2\\) value hasn’t improved at all, suggesting that you may have too many variables.\nAt this stage, you would probably remove some variables, perhaps by trial and error. How would you do this? You could start by running linear models over and over again. For example, you could construct one linear model for each variable and see which one has the largest contribution. Then you could try adding a second variable from among the remaining variables, and do that with each remaining variable, until you find one that adds the Largest contribution. You could continue in this way until you’ve accounted for all the variables, but would take forever to do. Luckily, R has functions to assist with this process and run regressions for you over and over again. I’m going to demonstrate one of them now for which we have to add the leaps package. I should point out that this involves doing some machine learning which is not strictly in the scope of this class, but will save you a lot of time.\n\nlibrary(caret)\nlibrary(leaps)\nset.seed(123)\ntrain.control &lt;- trainControl(method = \"cv\", number = 10)\nm &lt;- train(mpg ~ ., data = mtcars,\n                    method = \"leapBackward\",\n                    tuneGrid = data.frame(nvmax = 1:10),\n                    trControl = train.control\n                    )\nm$results\n\n   nvmax     RMSE  Rsquared      MAE   RMSESD RsquaredSD    MAESD\n1      1 3.528852 0.8077208 3.015705 1.765926  0.2320177 1.529370\n2      2 3.104015 0.8306301 2.507496 1.355870  0.2108183 0.884356\n3      3 3.211552 0.8255871 2.700867 1.359334  0.2077318 1.033360\n4      4 3.148479 0.8296845 2.630645 1.354017  0.1908016 1.074414\n5      5 3.254928 0.8164973 2.737739 1.266874  0.2309531 1.044970\n6      6 3.259540 0.8212797 2.749594 1.227337  0.2493678 1.043727\n7      7 3.322310 0.8570599 2.787698 1.408879  0.1592820 1.153164\n8      8 3.297613 0.8666992 2.744000 1.364396  0.1529011 1.114000\n9      9 3.330123 0.8632282 2.751539 1.385199  0.1600841 1.111120\n10    10 3.286242 0.8588116 2.715828 1.362054  0.1739366 1.120088\n\nm$bestTune[,1]\n\n[1] 2\n\nsummary(m$finalModel)\n\nSubset selection object\n10 Variables  (and intercept)\n     Forced in Forced out\ncyl      FALSE      FALSE\ndisp     FALSE      FALSE\nhp       FALSE      FALSE\ndrat     FALSE      FALSE\nwt       FALSE      FALSE\nqsec     FALSE      FALSE\nvs       FALSE      FALSE\nam       FALSE      FALSE\ngear     FALSE      FALSE\ncarb     FALSE      FALSE\n1 subsets of each size up to 2\nSelection Algorithm: backward\n         cyl disp hp  drat wt  qsec vs  am  gear carb\n1  ( 1 ) \" \" \" \"  \" \" \" \"  \"*\" \" \"  \" \" \" \" \" \"  \" \" \n2  ( 1 ) \" \" \" \"  \" \" \" \"  \"*\" \"*\"  \" \" \" \" \" \"  \" \" \n\ncoef(m$finalModel,m$bestTune[,1])\n\n(Intercept)          wt        qsec \n  19.746223   -5.047982    0.929198 \n\nsummary(lm(mpg~wt+qsec,data=mtcars))\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = mpg ~ wt + qsec, data = mtcars)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-4.3962 -2.1431 -0.2129  1.4915  5.7486 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

The latter model has the best adjusted \\(R^2\\) value. But it also has what appears to be a spurious variable, hp. It could be that hp is contributing indirectly, by being collinear with one of the other variables. Should we take it out and try again or should we accept the two variable model? That depends on several factors.\nThere is a principle called Occam’s Razor, named after William of Occam (who didn’t invent it, by the way—things often get named after popularizers rather than inventors). The principle states that, if two explanations have the same explanatory power, you should accept the simpler one. In this context, simpler means fewer variables. The tricky part is what is meant by the same explanatory power. Here we have a comparison of 0.8368 adjusted \\(R^2\\) vs 0.8144. Are those close enough to be considered the same? It depends on the context. If you’re a car buyer I would say yes but if you’re a car manufacturer I would say no. Your opinion might differ. It’s easy to teach the mechanics of these methods (even if you don’t think so yet!) but much harder to come up with the insights to interpret them. (Actually, I would probably choose the three variable model of wt, qsec, and am, but you can test that for yourself.)\n\n\n\n\nDiez, David, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Cristopher D Barr. 2019.

Each one gives us information about the quality of the model.\n\n10.2.1 Residuals vs Fitted\nThis plot tells you the magnitude of the difference between the residuals and the fitted values. There are three things to watch for here. First, are there any drastic outliers? Yes, there are two, points 65 and 20. (Those are row numbers in the data frame.) You need to investigate those and decide whether to omit them from further analysis. Were they typos? Mismeasurements? Or is the process from which they derive intrinsically subject to occasional extreme variation. In the third case, you probably don’t want to omit them.\nSecond, is the solid red line near the dashed zero line? Yes it is, indicating that the residuals have a mean of approximately zero. (The red line shows the mean of the residuals in the immediate region of the \\(x\\)-values of the observed data.)\nThird, is there a pattern to the residuals? No, there is not. The residuals appear to be of the same general magnitude at one end as the other. The things that would need action would be a curve or multiple curves, or a widening or narrowing shape, like the cross section of a horn.\n\n\n10.2.2 Normal Q-Q\nThis is an important plot. I see many students erroneously claiming that residuals are normally distributed because they have a vague bell shape. That is not good enough to detect normality. The Q-Q plot is the standard way to detect normality. If the points lie along the dashed line, you can be reasonably safe in an assumption of normality. If they deviate from the dashed line, the residuals are probably not normally distributed.\n\n\n10.2.3 Scale-Location\nLook for two things here. First, the red line should be approximately horizontal, meaning that there is not much variability in the standardized residuals. Second, look at the spread of the points around the red line. If they don’t show a pattrn, this reinforces the assumption of homoscedasticity that we already found evidence for in the first plot.\n\n\n10.2.4 Residuals vs Leverage\nThis shows you influential points that you may want to remove. Point 84 has high leverage (potential for influence) but is probably not actually very influential because it is so far from Cook’s Distance. Points 20 and 65 are outliers but only point 20 is more than Cook’s Distance away from the mean. In this case, you would likely remove point 20 from consideration unless there were a mitigating reason. For example, game collectors often pay extra for a game that has unusual attributes, such as shrink-wrapped original edition. As an example of a point you would definitely remove, draw a horizontal line from point 20 to a vertical line from point 84. Where they meet would be a high-leverage outlier that is unduly affecting the model no matter what it’s underlying cause. On the other hand, what if you have many such points? Unfortunately, that probably means the model isn’t very good.\n\n\n10.2.5 Removing offending observations\nSuppose we want to get rid of points 20 and 65 and rerun the regression. We could either do this using plain R or the tidyverse. I prefer the tidyverse method because of clarity of exposition.\n\ndf &lt;- mariokart |&gt;\n  filter(!row_number() %in% c(20, 65))\nm&lt;-(lm(total_pr~cond+stock_photo+duration+wheels,data=df))\nsummary(m)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = total_pr ~ cond + stock_photo + duration + wheels, \n    data = df)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-11.3788  -2.9854  -0.9654   2.6915  14.0346 \n\nCoefficients:\n               Estimate Std.

Keep in mind, though, that I just did this as an example. Points 20 and 65 may be totally legitimate in this case. Also, note that you could use plain R without the tidyverse to eliminate those rows by saying something like df &lt;- mariokart[-c(20,65),]. The bracket notation assumes anything before the comma refers to a row and anything after a comma refers to a column. In this case, I didn’t say anything about the columns, so the square brackets just have a dangling comma in them. The important point is that one method or another may seem more natural to you. For most students, the tidyverse approach is probably more natural, so I highlight that."

    "text": "10.3 Logistic Regression\nLogistic regression is a kind classification rather than regression. The book doesn’t make this point, but most textbooks do. You can divide machine learning problems into problems of regression and problems of classification. In regression, the \\(y\\) variable is more or less continuous, whereas in the classification problem, \\(y\\) is a set of categories, ordered or not. The word logistic comes from the logistic function, which is illustrated below. This interesting function takes an input from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(+\\infty\\) and gives an output between zero and one. It can be used to reduce wildly varying inputs into a yes / no decision. It is also known as the sigmoid function.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that zero and one happen to be the boundaries of a probability measure.

In this example, the bank wants to divide customers into those likely to buy and those unlikely to buy some banking product. They would like to divide the customers into these two groups using logistic regression, with a cutoff point of fifty-fifty. If there’s better than a fifty-fifty chance, they will send a salesperson but if there’s less than a fifty-fifty chance, they won’t send a salesperson.\n\nlibrary(tidymodels)\n\n#.

It can be tedious to adjust these aspects, called penalty and mixture, so here’s a technique for doing it automatically. You’ll learn about this and similar techniques if you take a more advanced course like 310D, Intro to Data Science.\n\n#.

    "text": "11.3 Dates and times\nFor the final exam, you will have to create the \\(y\\) variable as a time span. Chapter 18 of Wickham, Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Grolemund (2023) tells you how to do this. Let’s review that chapter.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(nycflights13)\ntoday()\n\n[1] \"2023-08-15\"\n\nnow()\n\n[1] \"2023-08-15 11:33:25 CDT\"\n\n\nSuppose you have a comma-separated-values (csv) file containing ISO-formatted dates or date-times.

You can do this for an ambiguous format:\n\ncsv &lt;- \"\n  date\n  01/02/15\n\"\n\nread_csv(csv, col_types = cols(date = col_date(\"%m/%d/%y\")))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  date      \n  &lt;date&gt;    \n1 2015-01-02\n\nread_csv(csv, col_types = cols(date = col_date(\"%d/%m/%y\")))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  date      \n  &lt;date&gt;    \n1 2015-02-01\n\nread_csv(csv, col_types = cols(date = col_date(\"%y/%m/%d\")))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  date      \n  &lt;date&gt;    \n1 2001-02-15\n\n\nThe letters after the percent signs are format specifiers. Wickham, Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Grolemund (2023) has a long list of them in Chapter 18.\nAn alternative to the above approach is to use the helpers in the lubridate package, which is part of the tidyverse collection of packages. There are two kinds of helpers.

The SQL version is piped (by default) to SQLite3, which doesn’t know the width of your display and which returns a single column response. You can substitute other database engines for SQLite3, such as PostgreSQL and MySQL. SQLite3 is an extremely fast, tiny database engine which is useful for single-user applications. For example, most smartphone applications (including all Android and iOS) use SQLite3 to store information, making SQLite3 the world’s most popular database (by some measures). SQLite3 is also used by most web browsers to store information.\nRecently (like within the last month) it was brought to the attention of the faculty that students want to learn more SQL. That’s the reason I’ve added this mention of sqldf. In a later iteration of the course, I will require some use of SQL but I learned of the need for this too late to incorporate it this semester. So your study of sqldf this semester will be optional.\n\n\n\n\nWickham, Hadley, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund. 2023.

It’s easy to split tasks apart, but then the report doesn’t look coherent. You have to try to work as a team. That’s why I’m giving you class time to work together. The two things are the regression diagnostics and fixing the earlier problems.\n\n12.2.1 Some tips on m4\n\nName the files m4.qmd and m4.html\nWhen I download them, I will automatically strip off any -1 or similar things that Canvas has put on\nThe title in the report header should be “Final Report” and must include the names of all contributing team members\nIt will be graded on the full contents, not just the regression diagnostics\n\n\n\n12.2.2 Strategy\n\nI previously suggested that you append your initials to df to name data frames, but almost no one did that.\nI suggest you work together on a first code chunk that massages the original data frame into what you want, then have individual work on chunks where you give the modified data frames unique names that don’t overlap.\nDon’t keep reading the original file in over and over again during your report. This overwrites any previous modifications you made to it.\nDon’t leave the final report to one group member. You must all look it over.\n\n\n\n12.2.3 More tips\n\nIf you have a Mac or if you have WSL2 on Windows, you can have a terminal\nYou can use the terminal to find out whether you are overwriting code with other code\nsay grep -n &lt;- m4.qmd at the terminal prompt and the output will be the lines and line numbers of all the places you assign names. You can then sort this output by extending the previous command as follows\nsay grep -n '&lt;-' m4.qmd | sort -k 2 -t : at the terminal prompt to get the assignments sorted by variable. That makes it easy to see if you’ve assigned to the same variable multiple times."

The correction, made by p.adjust(), is because the more hypotheses we check, the higher the probability of a Type I error, a false positive. That is, the more hypotheses we test, the higher the probability that one will appear true by chance.

There are several ways to do this. The following uses the plyr package. ::: {.cell}\nplyr::ddply(srchscrl, ~ Technique,\n      function(data) summary(data$Time))\n\n  Technique Min. 1st Qu. Median  Mean 3rd Qu. Max.\n1    Scroll   49  123.50  148.5 137.2     161  192\n2    Search   50   86.75   99.5  96.8     106  147\n\nplyr::ddply(srchscrl, ~ Technique,\n      summarise, Time.mean=mean(Time), Time.sd=sd(Time))\n\n  Technique Time.mean  Time.sd\n1    Scroll     137.2 35.80885\n2    Search      96.8 23.23020\n\n:::\nAnother approach is to use the dplyr package. Be aware that it conflicts with plyr so you should try to avoid using both. If you must use both, as I did above, it may make the most sense to call particular functions from the plyr package rather than load the package. This is what I did with plyr::ddply() above.\n\nsrchscrl |&gt;\n  group_by(Technique) |&gt;\n  summarize(mean=mean(Time),sd=sd(Time))\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  Technique  mean    sd\n  &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Scroll    137.   35.8\n2 Search     96.8  23.2\n\n\nYou can explore the Time response by making histograms or boxplots. One approach is to use the ggplot2 package and put the histograms together in one frame. The ggplot2 package allows for a remarkable variety of options.\n\nggplot(srchscrl,aes(Time,fill=Technique)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=30,alpha=0.9,position=position_dodge()) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette=\"Blues\") +\n  theme_tufte(base_size=8)\n\n\n\n\nWe can use the same package for boxplots. Boxplots show the median as a bold line in the middle of the box. The box itself ranges from the first quartile (starting at the 25th percentile) to the third quartile (terminating at the 75th percentile). The whiskers run from the minimum to the maximum, where these are defined as the 25th percentile minus 1.5 times the interquartile range and the 75th percentile plus 1.5 times the interquartile range. The interquartile range is the width of the box. Dots outside the whiskers show outliers.\n\nggplot(srchscrl,aes(Technique,Time,fill=Technique)) +\n  geom_boxplot(show.legend=FALSE) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette=\"Blues\") +\n  theme_tufte(base_size=8)\n\n\n\n\nWe would rather use parametric statistics if ANOVA assumptions are met. Recall that we can test for normality, normality of residuals, and homoscedasticity. In the case of a within-subjects experiment, we can also test for order effects which is one way to test the independence assumption. First test whether these times seem to be drawn from a normal distribution.\n\nshapiro.test(srchscrl[srchscrl$Technique == \"Search\",]$Time)\n\n\n    Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n\ndata:  srchscrl[srchscrl$Technique == \"Search\", ]$Time\nW = 0.96858, p-value = 0.7247\n\nshapiro.test(srchscrl[srchscrl$Technique == \"Scroll\",]$Time)\n\n\n    Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n\ndata:  srchscrl[srchscrl$Technique == \"Scroll\", ]$Time\nW = 0.91836, p-value = 0.09213\n\n\nIn both cases we fail to reject the null hypothesis, which is that the Time data are drawn from a normal distribution. Note that we fail to reject at \\(\\alpha=0.05\\) but that in the case of the Scroll technique we would reject at \\(\\alpha=0.1\\).\nFit a model for testing residuals—the Error function is used to indicate within-subject effects, i.e., each Subject was exposed to all levels of Technique. generally, Error(S/(ABC)) means each S was exposed to every level of A, B, C and S is a column encoding subject ids.\n\nm &lt;- aov(Time ~ Technique + Error(Subject/Technique),\n    data=srchscrl)\n\nThe above-specified model has residuals—departures of the observed data from the data that would be expected if the model were accurate.\nNow we can test the residuals of this model for normality and also examine a QQ plot for normality. The QQ plot shows the theoretical line to which the residuals should adhere if they are normally distributed. Deviations from that line are indications of non-normality. First test by Subject.\n\nshapiro.test(residuals(m$Subject))\n\n\n    Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n\ndata:  residuals(m$Subject)\nW = 0.9603, p-value = 0.5783\n\nqqnorm(residuals(m$Subject)) \nqqline(residuals(m$Subject))\n\n\n\n\nWe fail to reject the null hypothesis of normality and the QQ plot looks normal. So far, so good.\nNext test by Subject:Technique.\n\nshapiro.test(residuals(m$'Subject:Technique'))\n\n\n    Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n\ndata:  residuals(m$\"Subject:Technique\")\nW = 0.97303, p-value = 0.8172\n\nqqnorm(residuals(m$'Subject:Technique'))\nqqline(residuals(m$'Subject:Technique'))\n\n\n\n\nWe fail to reject the null hypothesis of normality and the QQ plot looks normal. We’re getting there.\nWe’re still checking the ANOVA assumptions. Next thing to test is homoscedasticity, the assumption of equal variance. For this we use the Brown-Forsythe test, a variant of Levene’s test that uses the median instead of the mean, providing greater robustness against non-normal data.\n\nleveneTest(Time ~ Technique, data=srchscrl, center=median)\n\nLevene's Test for Homogeneity of Variance (center = median)\n      Df F value Pr(&gt;F)\ngroup  1  2.0088 0.1645\n      38               \n\n\nThis experiment used counterbalancing to ward off the possibility of an order effect. An order effect results from learning or fatigue or some other factor based on the order in which the tests were run. We would like to not have that happen and one solution is to have half the subjects do task A first and half the subjects do task B first. This is the simplest form of counterbalancing. It becomes more problematic if there are more than two tasks.\nFor a paired-samples \\(t\\)-test we must use a wide-format table; most R functions do not require a wide-format table, but the dcast() function offers a quick way to translate long-format into wide-format when we need it.\nA wide-format table has one subject in every row. A long-format table has one observation in every row. Most R functions use long-format tables.\n\nlibrary(reshape2)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'reshape2'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:tidyr':\n\n    smiths\n\nsrchscrl.wide.order &lt;- dcast(srchscrl, Subject ~ Order,\n                 value.var=\"Time\")\n\nxtable(head(srchscrl.wide.order),\n       caption=\"First rows of wide order\")\nNow conduct a \\(t\\)-test to see if order has an effect. ::: {.cell}\nt.test(srchscrl.wide.order$\"1\", srchscrl.wide.order$\"2\",\n       paired=TRUE, var.equal=TRUE)\n\n\n    Paired t-test\n\ndata:  srchscrl.wide.order$\"1\" and srchscrl.wide.order$\"2\"\nt = -1.3304, df = 19, p-value = 0.1991\nalternative hypothesis: true mean difference is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -47.34704  10.54704\nsample estimates:\nmean difference \n          -18.4 \n\n:::\nWe fail to reject the null hypothesis that the responses do not differ according to order.

This is a parametric test of Time where we pair subjects by technique. Again, we need the wide-format table to conduct a paired test. The wide-format table has one row for each subject rather than one row for each observation.\n\nsrchscrl.wide.tech = dcast(srchscrl, Subject ~ Technique,\n               value.var=\"Time\")\n\nxtable(head(srchscrl.wide.tech),\n       caption=\"First rows of wide technique\")\n\nt.test(srchscrl.wide.tech$Search, srchscrl.wide.tech$Scroll,\n       paired=TRUE, var.equal=TRUE)\n\n\n    Paired t-test\n\ndata:  srchscrl.wide.tech$Search and srchscrl.wide.tech$Scroll\nt = -3.6399, df = 19, p-value = 0.001743\nalternative hypothesis: true mean difference is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -63.63083 -17.16917\nsample estimates:\nmean difference \n          -40.4 \n\n\nThis supports the intuition we developed doing the histogram and boxplots only now we have a valid statistical test to support this intuition.\nSuppose we did not satisfy the ANOVA assumptions.

It refers to the condition where the variances of the differences between all possible pairs of within-subject conditions (i.e., levels of the independent variable) are equal. The violation of sphericity occurs when it is not the case that the variances of the differences between all combinations of the conditions are equal. If sphericity is violated, then the variance calculations may be distorted, which would result in an \\(F\\)-ratio that would be inflated.” (from the Wikipedia article on Mauchly’s sphericity test)\nMauchly’s test of sphericity above tells us that there is not a significant departure from sphericity, so we can better rely on the \\(F\\)-statistic in the following ANOVA, the purpose of which is to detect any order effect that would interfere with our later results.\n\nm$ANOVA\n\n                  Effect DFn DFd            F            p p&lt;.05          ges\n2               Keyboard   1  22 1.244151e+02 1.596641e-10     * 0.0794723123\n3          Posture_Order   2  44 5.166254e-02 9.497068e-01       0.0023071128\n4 Keyboard:Posture_Order   2  44 2.830819e-03 9.971734e-01       0.0001266932\n\n\nThe \\(F\\)-statistic for Posture_Order is very small, indicating that there is not an order effect.

    "text": "13.6 Differences between people’s performance and within a person’s performance (Two-way mixed factorial ANOVA)\nSince a mixed factorial design by definition has both a between-subjects and a within-subjects factor, we don’t need to also mention that this is a repeated measures test.\n\nm &lt;- ezANOVA(dv=WPM,\n            between=Keyboard,\n            within=Posture,\n            wid=Subject,\n            data=mbltxt)\nm$Mauchly\n\n            Effect         W           p p&lt;.05\n3          Posture 0.6370236 0.008782794     *\n4 Keyboard:Posture 0.6370236 0.008782794     *\n\n\nIn this case, sphericity is violated, so we need to additionally apply the Greenhouse-Geisser correction or the less conservative Huyn-Feldt correction. Nevertheless, let’s look at the uncorrected ANOVA table. Later, we’ll compare it with the uncorrected version provided by the aov() function.\n\nm$ANOVA\n\n            Effect DFn DFd        F            p p&lt;.05       ges\n2         Keyboard   1  22 124.4151 1.596641e-10     * 0.6151917\n3          Posture   2  44 381.4980 1.602465e-28     * 0.9255880\n4 Keyboard:Posture   2  44 157.1600 9.162076e-21     * 0.8367128\n\n\nNote that “ges” in the ANOVA table is the generalized eta-squared measure of effect size, \\(\\eta^2_G\\), preferred to eta-squared or partial eta-squared. See Roger Bakeman (2005) “Recommended effect size statistics for repeated measures designs”, Behavior Research Methods, 37 (3) pages 379–384. There, he points out that the usual \\(\\eta^2\\) is the ratio of effect to total variance:\n\\[\\eta^2=\\frac{SS_{\\text{effect}}}{SS_{\\text{total}}}\\]\nwhere \\(SS\\) is sum of squares. This is similar to the \\(R^2\\) measure typically reported for regression results. The generalized version is alleged to compensate for the deficiencies that \\(\\eta^2\\) shares with \\(R^2\\), mainly that it can be improved by simply adding more predictors. The generalized version looks like this:\n\\[\\eta^2_G=\\frac{SS_{\\text{effect}}}{\\delta \\times SS_{\\text{effect}} + \\sum SS_{\\text{measured}}}\\]\nHere \\(\\delta=0\\) if the effect involves one or more measured factors and \\(\\delta=1\\) if the effect involves only manipulated factors. (Actually it is a little more complicated—here I’m just trying to convey a crude idea that \\(\\eta^2_G\\) ranges between 0 and 1 and that, as it approaches 1, the size of the effect is greater. Oddly enough, it is common to report effect sizes as simply small, medium, or large.)\nNow compute the corrected degrees of freedom for each corrected effect.\n\npos &lt;- match(m$'Sphericity Corrections'$Effect,\n            m$ANOVA$Effect) # positions of within-Ss efx in m$ANOVA\nm$Sphericity$GGe.DFn &lt;- m$Sphericity$GGe * m$ANOVA$DFn[pos] # Greenhouse-Geisser\nm$Sphericity$GGe.DFd &lt;- m$Sphericity$GGe * m$ANOVA$DFd[pos]\nm$Sphericity$HFe.DFn &lt;- m$Sphericity$HFe * m$ANOVA$DFn[pos] # Huynh-Feldt\nm$Sphericity$HFe.DFd &lt;- m$Sphericity$HFe * m$ANOVA$DFd[pos]\nm$Sphericity\n\n            Effect       GGe        p[GG] p[GG]&lt;.05       HFe        p[HF]\n3          Posture 0.7336884 1.558280e-21         * 0.7731517 1.432947e-22\n4 Keyboard:Posture 0.7336884 7.800756e-16         * 0.7731517 1.447657e-16\n  p[HF]&lt;.05  GGe.DFn  GGe.DFd  HFe.DFn  HFe.DFd\n3         * 1.467377 32.28229 1.546303 34.01868\n4         * 1.467377 32.28229 1.546303 34.01868\n\n\nThe above table shows the Greenhouse Geisser correction to the numerator (GGe.DFn) and denominator (GGe.DFd) degrees of freedom and the resulting \\(p\\)-values (p[GG]). The Greenhouse Geiser epsilon statistic (\\(\\epsilon\\)) is shown as GGe. There is an analogous set of measures for the less conservative Huynh-Feldt correction.

    "text": "13.10 What if errors are not normally distributed? (Generalized linear models)\nHere are three examples of generalized linear models. The first is analyzed using nominal logistic regression, the second is analyzed via ordinal logistic regression, and the third is analyzed via Poisson regression.\nAs Wikipedia tells us, a generalized linear model or GLM is a flexible generalization of ordinary linear regression that allows for response variables with error distribution models other than a normal distribution. There is also something called a general linear model but it is not the same thing as a generalized linear model. It is just the general form of the ordinary linear regression model: \\(\\mathbfit{Y=X\\beta+\\epsilon}\\).\nGLMs that we examine here are good for between-subjects studies so we’ll actually recode one of our fictitious data sets to be between subjects just to have an example to use.\n\n13.10.1 Preferences among websites by males and females (GLM 1: Nominal logistic regression for preference responses)\n\n\n13.10.2 Multinomial distribution with logit link function\nThe prefsABCsex.csv file records preferences among three websites A, B, and C expressed by males and females. The subject number, preference and sex were recorded.\nThe logit link function is the log odds function, generally \\(\\text{logit}(p)=\\ln \\frac{p}{1-p}\\), where \\(p\\) is the probability of an event such as choosing website A. The form of the link function is \\(\\mathbfit{X\\beta}=\\ln\\frac{\\mu}{1-\\mu}\\). This is just the relationship of a matrix of predictors times a vector of parameters \\(\\mathbfit{\\beta}\\) to the logit of the mean of the distribution.\n\nprefsABCsex &lt;- read_csv(paste0(Sys.getenv(\"STATS_DATA_DIR\"),\"/prefsABCsex.csv\"))\nhead(prefsABCsex)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  Subject Pref  Sex  \n    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;\n1       1 C     F    \n2       2 C     M    \n3       3 B     M    \n4       4 C     M    \n5       5 C     M    \n6       6 B     F    \n\nprefsABCsex$Subject&lt;-factor(prefsABCsex$Subject)\nprefsABCsex$Sex&lt;-factor(prefsABCsex$Sex)\nsummary(prefsABCsex)\n\n    Subject       Pref           Sex   \n 1      : 1   Length:60          F:29  \n 2      : 1   Class :character   M:31  \n 3      : 1   Mode  :character         \n 4      : 1                            \n 5      : 1                            \n 6      : 1                            \n (Other):54                            \n\nggplot(prefsABCsex[prefsABCsex$Sex == \"M\",],aes(Pref)) +\n  theme_tufte() +\n  geom_bar(width=0.25,fill=\"gray\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=seq(0, 20, 5), col=\"white\", lwd=1) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 1.5, y = 18, adj=1,  family=\"serif\",\n    label = c(\"Males prefer\\nwebsite C\"))\n\n\n\nggplot(prefsABCsex[prefsABCsex$Sex == \"F\",],aes(Pref)) +\n  theme_tufte() +\n  geom_bar(width=0.25,fill=\"gray\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=seq(0, 20, 5), col=\"white\", lwd=1) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 1.5, y = 18, adj=1,  family=\"serif\",\n    label = c(\"Females dislike\\nwebsite A\"))\n\n\n\n\nThese histograms lead us to suspect that C is preferred by males and that A is disliked by females, but we should still run tests to be convinced that the variability observed is not due to chance.\nAnalyze Pref by Sex using multinomial logistic regression, aka nominal logistic regression. Here we are testing for whether there is a difference between the sexes regarding their preferences.\nThe annotation type=3 is borrowed from SAS and refers to one of three ways of handling an unbalanced design. This experimental design is unbalanced because there are more males than females being tested. This way of handling the unbalanced design is only valid if there are significant interactions, as hinted by the gross differences between the preceding histograms.\n\nlibrary(nnet) # provides multinom()\n#. library(car) # provides Anova()\n#. set sum-to-zero contrasts for the Anova call\ncontrasts(prefsABCsex$Sex) &lt;- \"contr.sum\"\nm&lt;-multinom(Pref~Sex, data=prefsABCsex)\n\n# weights:  9 (4 variable)\ninitial  value 65.916737 \niter  10 value 55.099353\niter  10 value 55.099353\nfinal  value 55.099353 \nconverged\n\nAnova(m, type=3)\n\nAnalysis of Deviance Table (Type III tests)\n\nResponse: Pref\n    LR Chisq Df Pr(&gt;Chisq)  \nSex   7.0744  2    0.02909 *\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nThe Analysis of Deviance table tells us that there is a significant main effect for Sex. It does not tell us more detail but motivates pairwise tests to get more detail. If there were no significant effect, pairwise tests would not be warranted.\nPairwise tests tell which of the bins are over or under populated based on the assumption that each bin should contain one third of the observations (hence p=1/3). When making multiple comparisons we would overstate the significance of the differences so we use Holm’s sequential Bonferroni procedure to correct this.\n\nma&lt;-binom.test(sum(prefsABCsex[prefsABCsex$Sex == \"M\",]$Pref == \"A\"),\n           nrow(prefsABCsex[prefsABCsex$Sex == \"M\",]), p=1/3)\nmb&lt;-binom.test(sum(prefsABCsex[prefsABCsex$Sex == \"M\",]$Pref == \"B\"),\n           nrow(prefsABCsex[prefsABCsex$Sex == \"M\",]), p=1/3)\nmc&lt;-binom.test(sum(prefsABCsex[prefsABCsex$Sex == \"M\",]$Pref == \"C\"),\n           nrow(prefsABCsex[prefsABCsex$Sex == \"M\",]), p=1/3)\n#. correct for multiple comparisons\np.adjust(c(ma$p.value, mb$p.value, mc$p.value), method=\"holm\")\n\n[1] 0.109473564 0.126622172 0.001296754\n\nfa&lt;-binom.test(sum(prefsABCsex[prefsABCsex$Sex == \"F\",]$Pref == \"A\"),\n           nrow(prefsABCsex[prefsABCsex$Sex == \"F\",]), p=1/3)\nfb&lt;-binom.test(sum(prefsABCsex[prefsABCsex$Sex == \"F\",]$Pref == \"B\"),\n           nrow(prefsABCsex[prefsABCsex$Sex == \"F\",]), p=1/3)\nfc&lt;-binom.test(sum(prefsABCsex[prefsABCsex$Sex == \"F\",]$Pref == \"C\"),\n           nrow(prefsABCsex[prefsABCsex$Sex == \"F\",]), p=1/3)\n#. correct for multiple comparisons\np.adjust(c(fa$p.value, fb$p.value, fc$p.value), method=\"holm\")\n\n[1] 0.02703274 0.09447821 0.69396951\n\n\nThe preceding tests confirm what we suspected from looking at histograms: males prefer C and females dislike A. We see this by looking at the adjusted \\(p\\)-values, where the first row, third value is significant and the second row, first value is significant.\nHow would we write this up in a report? We could make the following claim. We tested the main effect for sex and found a significant result, \\(\\chi^2_2=7.1, p&lt;0.05\\). An exact binomial test found the preference among males for website C greater than chance, \\(p&lt;0.01\\). An exact binomial test found the preference among females against website A greater than chance, \\(p&lt;0.05\\). No other significant differences were found.\n\n\n13.10.3 Judgments of perceived effort (GLM 2: Ordinal logistic regression for Likert responses)\n\n\n13.10.4 Multinomial distribution with cumulative logit link function\nIn this example, users are either searching, scrolling or using voice to find contacts in a smartphone address book. The time it takes to find a certain number of contacts, the perceived effort, and the number of errors are all recorded. Of interest now is the perceived effort, recorded on a Likert scale. A Likert scale can not be normally distributed because of the restrictions on the ends and is not likely to even look vaguely normal.\nThe cumulative logit link function is like the logit link function:\n\\[\\text{logit}(P(Y\\leqslant j|x))=\\ln\\frac{P(Y\\leqslant j|x)}{1-P(Y\\leqslant j|x)} \\text{ where }Y=1,2,\\ldots,J\\]\nIn this case \\(J\\) ranges from 1 to 7.\nRead in the data and examine it. We see that it is a within-subjects study but it is a fictitious study anyway so we will recode it as if it were a between-subjects study.

Since we are now convinced of the Poisson distribution for each of the three techniques, analyze the errors using Poisson regression.\nWe’ve been saying “set sum-to-zero contrasts for the Anova call” but what does that mean? Contrasts are linear combinations used in ANOVA. As Wikipedia defines it, a contrast is a linear combination \\(\\sum^t_{i=1}a_i\\theta_i\\), where each \\(\\theta_i\\) is a statistic and the \\(a_i\\) values sum to zero. Typically, the \\(a_i\\) values are \\(1\\) and \\(-1\\). A simple contrast represents a difference between means and is used in ANOVA. In R, they are invisible if you use Type I ANOVA, but have to be specified as follows if using a Type III ANOVA. The default anova() function is Type I but we’re using Type III, available from the Anova() function in the car package.\nA minor detail is that we don’t really need to use Anova() here instead of anova() because the study is balanced, meaning that it has the same number of observations in each condition. The only reason for using Anova() on this data is that it gives a better-looking output. The anova() function would just display the \\(\\chi^2\\) statistic without the associated \\(p\\)-value.\n\ncontrasts(srchscrlvce$Technique) &lt;- \"contr.sum\"\n#. family parameter identifies both distribution and link fn\nm &lt;- glm(Errors ~ Technique, data=srchscrlvce, family=poisson)\nAnova(m, type=3)\n\nAnalysis of Deviance Table (Type III tests)\n\nResponse: Errors\n          LR Chisq Df Pr(&gt;Chisq)    \nTechnique    74.93  2  &lt; 2.2e-16 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nBecause the Analysis of Deviance table shows a significant \\(\\chi^2\\) value and corresponding \\(p\\)-value, we are justified to conduct pairwise comparisons among levels of Technique.\n\n#. library(multcomp)\nsummary(glht(m, mcp(Technique=\"Tukey\")), test=adjusted(type=\"holm\"))\n\n\n     Simultaneous Tests for General Linear Hypotheses\n\nMultiple Comparisons of Means: Tukey Contrasts\n\n\nFit: glm(formula = Errors ~ Technique, family = poisson, data = srchscrlvce)\n\nLinear Hypotheses:\n                     Estimate Std.

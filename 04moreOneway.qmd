### Another example of tasks using two tools (More on oneway ANOVA)

The `designtime` data records task times in minutes to complete the same project in Illustrator or InDesign.

Read the designtime data into R. Determine how many subjects participated.

```{r}
dt <- read_csv(paste0(Sys.getenv("STATS_DATA_DIR"),"/designtime.csv"))
#. convert Subject to a factor
dt$Subject<-as.factor(dt$Subject)
dt$Tool<-as.factor(dt$Tool)
summary(dt)
length(dt$Subject)
tail(dt)
```

We see from the summary that there are sixty observations. We can see the same by checking the `length()` of the Subject (or any other) variable in the data.

Create a boxplot of the task time for each tool and comment on the medians and variances.

```{r}
ggplot(dt,aes(Tool,Time,fill=Tool)) +
  geom_boxplot(show.legend=FALSE) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Blues") +
  theme_tufte(base_size=8)
```

Both the median and the variance is much larger for Illustrator than for InDesign.

Conduct a Shapiro-Wilk test for normality for each tool and comment.

```{r}
shapiro.test(dt[dt$Tool=="Illustrator",]$Time)
shapiro.test(dt[dt$Tool=="InDesign",]$Time)
```

In the case of InDesign, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the data are drawn from a normal distribution. In the case of Illustrator, we reject the null hypothesis at the five percent level but not at the one percent level (just barely).

Conduct a Shapiro-Wilk test for normality on the residuals and comment.

```{r}
m<-aov(Time~Tool,data=dt)
shapiro.test(residuals(m))
```

We reject the null hypothesis that the residuals are normally distributed.

Conduct a Brown-Forsythe test of homoscedasticity.

```{r}
leveneTest(Time~Tool,data=dt,center=median)
```

We reject the null hypothesis that the two samples are drawn from populations with equal variance.

Fit a lognormal distribution to the Time response for each Tool. Conduct a Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit test and comment.

```{r}
fit<-fitdistr(dt[dt$Tool=="Illustrator",]$Time,
    "lognormal")$estimate
tst<-ks.test(dt[dt$Tool=="Illustrator",]$Time,
    "plnorm",meanlog=fit[1],sdlog=fit[2],exact=TRUE)
tst
fit<-fitdistr(dt[dt$Tool=="InDesign",]$Time,
    "lognormal")$estimate
tst<-ks.test(dt[dt$Tool=="InDesign",]$Time,
    "plnorm",meanlog=fit[1],sdlog=fit[2],exact=TRUE)
tst
```

We fail to reject the null hypothesis that the Illustrator sample is drawn from a lognormal distribution.
We fail to reject the null hypothesis that the InDesign sample is drawn from a lognormal distribution.

Create a log-transformed Time response column. Compute the mean for each tool and comment.

```{r}
dt$logTime<-log(dt$Time)
mean(dt$logTime[dt$Tool=="Illustrator"])
mean(dt$logTime[dt$Tool=="InDesign"])
dt |>
  group_by(Tool) |>
  summarize(mean=mean(logTime),sd=sd(logTime))
```

The mean for Illustrator appears to be larger than the mean for InDesign.

Conduct an independent-samples $t$-test on the log-transformed Time response, using the Welch version for unequal variances and comment.

```{r}
t.test(logTime~Tool,data=dt,var.equal=FALSE)
```

We reject the null hypothesis that the true difference in means is equal to 0.

Conduct an exact nonparametric Mann-Whitney $U$ test on the Time response and comment.

```{r}
wilcox_test(Time~Tool,data=dt,distribution="exact")
```

We reject the null hypothesis that the samples were drawn from populations with the same distribution.
